## About

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on Algorithms with Predictions and to curate links to further relevant materials. This resource is intended to help new researchers quickly orient themselves in the field while also serving as a valuable reference for the broader research community to organize and cluster the rapidly growing body of results and publications in this area. 

This project and its webpage are led and managed by [Alexander Lindermayr](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/team/alexander-lindermayr) and [Nicole Megow](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/nmegow). 

It is an [open source initiative](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io), and contributions from the community are highly encouraged, such as submitting references or links, suggesting improvements to presentation and organization, or sharing ideas for enhancing the platform. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly to [Alexander and Nicole](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de).

Further contributors: [Bertrand Simon](https://cclab.pages.in2p3.fr/bertrand.simon/), [Adam Polak](https://adampolak.github.io/), [Niklas Hahn](https://webia.lip6.fr/~nhahn/index.html), [Christoph Dürr](https://webia.lip6.fr/~durrc/)

Fortunately, the idea of this project has been picked up by other communities. The following forks of this project exist.
