title: Randomized learning-augmented auctions with revenue guarantees
authors: Caragiannis, Kalantzis
abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of designing a truthful single-item
  auction with the challenging objective of extracting a large fraction of the highest
  agent valuation as revenue. Following a recent trend in algorithm design, we assume
  that the agent valuations belong to a known interval, and a prediction for the highest
  valuation is available. Then, auction design aims for high consistency and robustness,
  meaning that, for appropriate pairs of values γ and ρ, the extracted revenue should
  be at least a γ- or ρ-fraction of the highest valuation when the prediction is correct
  for the input instance or not. We characterize all pairs of parameters γ and ρ so
  that a randomized γ-consistent and ρ-robust auction exists. Furthermore, for the
  setting in which robustness can be a function of the prediction error, we give sufficient
  and necessary conditions for the existence of robust auctions and present randomized
  auctions that extract a revenue that is only a polylogarithmic (in terms of the
  prediction error) factor away from the highest agent valuation.
