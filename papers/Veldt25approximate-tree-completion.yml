abstract: Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) for $n$ points in an arbitrary metric
  space is a fundamental primitive for hierarchical clustering and many other ML tasks,
  but this takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time to even approximate. We introduce a framework
  for metric MSTs that first (1) finds a forest of disconnected components using practical
  heuristics, and then (2) finds a small weight set of edges to connect disjoint components
  of the forest into a spanning tree. We prove that optimally solving the second step
  still takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time, but we provide a subquadratic 2.62-approximation
  algorithm. In the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms, we then show that if
  the forest found in step (1) overlaps with an optimal MST, we can approximate the
  original MST problem in subquadratic time, where the approximation factor depends
  on a measure of overlap. In practice, we find nearly optimal spanning trees for
  a wide range of metrics, while being orders of magnitude faster than exact algorithms.
