title: 'Faster Discrete Convex Function Minimization with Predictions: The M-Convex Case'
authors: Taihei Oki, Shinsaku Sakaue
abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in accelerating optimization algorithms with machine-learned predictions.
  Sakaue and Oki (NeurIPS 2022) have developed a general framework that warm-starts the L-convex function minimization method
  with predictions, revealing the idea's usefulness for various discrete optimization problems. In this paper, we present
  a framework for using predictions to accelerate M-convex function minimization, thus complementing previous research and
  extending the range of discrete optimization algorithms that can benefit from predictions. Our framework is particularly
  effective for an important subclass called laminar convex minimization, which appears in many operations research applications.
  Our methods can improve time complexity bounds upon the best worst-case results by using predictions and even have potential
  to go beyond a lower-bound result.
