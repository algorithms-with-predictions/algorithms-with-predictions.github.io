title: Lazy Lagrangians with Predictions for Online Learning
authors: Daron Anderson, George Iosifidis, Douglas J. Leith
abstract: We consider the general problem of online convex optimization with time-varying additive constraints in the presence
  of predictions for the next cost and constraint functions. A novel primal-dual algorithm is designed by combining a Follow-The-Regularized-Leader
  iteration with prediction-adaptive dynamic steps. The algorithm achieves $\mathcal O(T^{\frac{3-\beta}{4}})$ regret and
  $\mathcal O(T^{\frac{1+\beta}{2}})$ constraint violation bounds that are tunable via parameter $\beta\!\in\![1/2,1)$ and
  have constant factors that shrink with the predictions quality, achieving eventually $\mathcal O(1)$ regret for perfect
  predictions. Our work extends the FTRL framework for this constrained OCO setting and outperforms the respective state-of-the-art
  greedy-based solutions, without imposing conditions on the quality of predictions, the cost functions or the geometry of
  constraints, beyond convexity.
