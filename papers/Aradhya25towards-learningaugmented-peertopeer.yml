title: 'Towards Learning-Augmented Peer-to-Peer Networks: Self-Stabilizing Graph Linearization with Untrusted Advice'
authors: Vijeth Aradhya, Christian Scheideler
abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer systems are widely popular due to their decentralized nature, which ensures that no peer
  is critical for the functionality of the system. However, fully decentralized solutions are usually much harder to design,
  and tend to have a much higher overhead compared to centralized approaches, where the peers are connected to a powerful
  server. On the other hand, centralized approaches have a single point of failure. Thus, is there some way to combine their
  advantages without inheriting their disadvantages? To that end, we consider a supervised peer-to-peer approach where the
  peers can ask a potentially unreliable supervisor for advice. This is in line with the increasingly popular algorithmic
  paradigm called algorithms with predictions or learning-augmented algorithms, but we are the first to consider it in the
  context of peer-to-peer networks. Specifically, we design self-stabilizing algorithms for the fundamental problem of distributed
  graph linearization, where peers are supposed to recover the"sorted line"network from any initial network after a transient
  fault. With the help of the supervisor, peers can recover the sorted line network in $O(\log n)$ time, if the advice is
  correct; otherwise, the algorithm retains its original recovery time (i.e., without any supervisor). A crucial challenge
  that we overcome is to correctly compose multiple self-stabilizing algorithms, that is, one that processes and exploits
  the advice, and another that does not rely on the advice at all. Our key technical contributions combine ideas from the
  fields of overlay networks and proof-labeling schemes. Finally, we give a matching lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for the
  recovery time of any algorithm if the advice can be corrupted, where $n$ is the network size.
