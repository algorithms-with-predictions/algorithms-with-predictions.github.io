title: 'Towards Learning-Augmented Peer-to-Peer Networks: Self-Stabilizing Graph Linearization
  with Untrusted Advice'
authors: Vijeth Aradhya, Christian Scheideler
abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer systems are widely popular due to their decentralized
  nature, which ensures that no peer is critical for the functionality of the system.
  However, fully decentralized solutions are usually much harder to design, and tend
  to have a much higher overhead compared to centralized approaches, where the peers
  are connected to a powerful server. On the other hand, centralized approaches have
  a single point of failure. Thus, is there some way to combine their advantages without
  inheriting their disadvantages? To that end, we consider a supervised peer-to-peer
  approach where the peers can ask a potentially unreliable supervisor for advice.
  This is in line with the increasingly popular algorithmic paradigm called algorithms
  with predictions or learning-augmented algorithms, but we are the first to consider
  it in the context of peer-to-peer networks. Specifically, we design self-stabilizing
  algorithms for the fundamental problem of distributed graph linearization, where
  peers are supposed to recover the"sorted line"network from any initial network after
  a transient fault. With the help of the supervisor, peers can recover the sorted
  line network in $O(\log n)$ time, if the advice is correct; otherwise, the algorithm
  retains its original recovery time (i.e., without any supervisor). A crucial challenge
  that we overcome is to correctly compose multiple self-stabilizing algorithms, that
  is, one that processes and exploits the advice, and another that does not rely on
  the advice at all. Our key technical contributions combine ideas from the fields
  of overlay networks and proof-labeling schemes. Finally, we give a matching lower
  bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for the recovery time of any algorithm if the advice can
  be corrupted, where $n$ is the network size.
