abstract: Machine-learned predictors, although achieving very good results for inputs resembling training data, cannot possibly
  provide perfect predictions in all situations. Still, decision-making systems that are based on such predictors need not
  only benefit from good predictions, but should also achieve a decent performance when the predictions are inadequate. In
  this article, we propose a prediction setup for arbitrary metrical task systems (MTS) (e.g., caching, k-server, and convex
  body chasing) and online matching on the line. We utilize results from the theory of online algorithms to show how to make
  the setup robust. Specifically, for caching, we present an algorithm whose performance, as a function of the prediction
  error, is exponentially better than what is achievable for general MTS. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our
  methods on real-world datasets, which suggests practicality.
