title: Online Computation with Untrusted Advice
authors: Angelopoulos, Dürr, Jin, Kamali, Renault
abstract: 'The advice model of online computation captures a setting in which the
  algorithm is given some partial information concerning the request sequence. This
  paradigm allows to establish tradeoffs between the amount of this additional information
  and the performance of the online algorithm. However, if the advice is corrupt or,
  worse, if it comes from a malicious source, the algorithm may perform poorly. In
  this work, we study online computation in a setting in which the advice is provided
  by an untrusted source. Our objective is to quantify the impact of untrusted advice
  so as to design and analyze online algorithms that are robust and perform well even
  when the advice is generated in a malicious, adversarial manner. To this end, we
  focus on well-studied online problems such as ski rental, online bidding, bin packing,
  and list update. For ski-rental and online bidding, we show how to obtain algorithms
  that are Pareto-optimal with respect to the competitive ratios achieved; this improves
  upon the framework of Purohit et al. [NeurIPS 2018] in which Pareto-optimality is
  not necessarily guaranteed. For bin packing and list update, we give online algorithms
  with worst-case tradeoffs in their competitiveness, depending on whether the advice
  is trusted or not; this is motivated by work of Lykouris and Vassilvitskii [ICML
  2018] on the paging problem, but in which the competitiveness depends on the reliability
  of the advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to prove lower bounds, within this
  model, on the tradeoff between the number of advice bits and the competitiveness
  of any online algorithm. Last, we study the effect of randomization: here we show
  that for ski-rental there is a randomized algorithm that Pareto-dominates any deterministic
  algorithm with advice of any size. We also show that a single random bit is not
  always inferior to a single advice bit, as it happens in the standard model.'
