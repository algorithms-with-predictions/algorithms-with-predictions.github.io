title: Real-Time Scheduling with Predictions
authors: Zhao, Li, Zomaya
abstract: The recent revival in learning theory gives us improved capabilities for
  accurate predictions and increased opportunities for performance enhancement. This
  work extends the research agenda of augmenting algorithms with predictions to one
  of the central scheduling problems – soft real-time scheduling on single and parallel
  machines to minimize the mean response time. We design an algorithm, PEDRMLF (Predictions
  Enhanced Dynamic Randomized MultiLevel Feedback), that incorporates job size predictions,
  achieving an optimal competitive ratio under perfect predictions and the best-known
  competitive ratio under any predictions. PEDRMLF is the first algorithm that simultaneously
  achieves optimal consistency and bounded robustness. Simulations show that the proposed
  algorithm performs close to the theoretically optimal bound while consistently outperforming
  state-of-the-art benchmarks.
