abstract: Neural models have shown promise in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial
  optimization (CO) problems. Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably
  high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally
  fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based
  algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search
  finishes. We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and
  exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based
  algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component.
  PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and
  allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the
  identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to
  identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles
  the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding.
  The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically
  and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably,
  our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better
  solutions than neural solvers alone. We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks.
  Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with
  that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory
  advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization,
  addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.
