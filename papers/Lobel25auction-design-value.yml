title: Auction Design using Value Prediction with Hallucinations
authors: Ilan Lobel, Humberto Moreira, Omar Mouchtaki
abstract: We investigate a Bayesian mechanism design problem where a seller seeks to maximize revenue by selling an indivisible
  good to one of n buyers, incorporating potentially unreliable predictions (signals) of buyers'private values derived from
  a machine learning model. We propose a framework where these signals are sometimes reflective of buyers'true valuations
  but other times are hallucinations, which are uncorrelated with the buyers'true valuations. Our main contribution is a characterization
  of the optimal auction under this framework. Our characterization establishes a near-decomposition of how to treat types
  above and below the signal. For the one buyer case, the seller's optimal strategy is to post one of three fairly intuitive
  prices depending on the signal, which we call the"ignore","follow"and"cap"actions.
