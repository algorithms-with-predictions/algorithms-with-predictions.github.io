title: Strategyproof Mechanisms for Facility Location with Prediction Under the Maximum
  Cost Objective
authors: Hau Chan, Jianan Lin, Chenhao Wang
abstract: 'We study the mechanism design problem of facility location on a metric
  space in the learning-augmented framework, where mechanisms have access to an imperfect
  prediction of optimal facility locations. Our goal is to design strategyproof (SP)
  mechanisms to elicit agent preferences on the facility locations truthfully and,
  leveraging the given imperfect prediction, determine the facility location that
  approximately minimizes the maximum cost among all agents. In particular, we seek
  SP mechanisms whose approximation guarantees depend on the prediction errors --
  achieve improved guarantees when the prediction is accurate (known as the \emph{consistency}),
  while still ensuring robust worst-case performance when the prediction is arbitrarily
  inaccurate (known as the \emph{robustness}). When the metric space is the real line,
  we characterize all deterministic SP mechanisms with consistency strictly less than
  2 and bounded robustness: such mechanisms must be the MinMaxP mechanism, which returns
  the prediction location if it lies between the two extreme agent locations and,
  otherwise, returns the closest agent location to the prediction. We further show
  that, for any prediction error $\eta\ge 0$, while MinMaxP is $(1+\min(1, \eta))$-approximation,
  no deterministic SP mechanism can achieve a better approximation. In two-dimensional
  spaces with the $l_p$ metric, we analyze the approximation guarantees of a deterministic
  mechanism that runs MinMaxP independently on each coordinate, as well as a randomized
  mechanism that selects between two deterministic ones with specific probabilities.
  Finally, we discuss the group strategyproofness of the considered mechanisms.'
