title: Trade-off Analysis in Learning-augmented Algorithms with Societal Design Criteria
authors: Mohammad H. Hajiesmaili
abstract: Traditionally, computer systems are designed to optimize classic notions
  of performance such as flow completion time, cost, etc. The system performance is
  then typically evaluated by characterizing theoretical bounds in worst-case settings
  over a single performance metric. In the next generation of computer systems, societal
  design criteria, such as carbon awareness and fairness, becomes a first-class design
  goal. However, the classic performance metrics may conflict with societal criteria.
  Foundational understanding and performance evaluations of systems with these inherent
  trade-offs lead to novel research questions that could be considered new educational
  components for performance analysis courses. The classic techniques, e.g., worst-case
  analysis, for systems with conflicting objectives may lead to the impossibility
  of results. However, a foundational understanding of the impossibility of results
  calls for new techniques and tools. In traditional performance evaluation, to understand
  the foundational limits, typically, it is sufficient to derive lower-bound arguments
  in worst-case settings. In the new era of system design, lower bounds are inherently
  about trade-offs between different objectives. Characterizing these trade-offs in
  settings with multiple design criteria is closer to the notion of Pareto-optimality,
  which is drastically different from classic lower bounds. With the impossibility
  of results using classic paradigms, one possible direction is to (re)design systems
  following the emerging direction of learning-augmented algorithms. With this approach,
  it might be possible to remove/mitigate the foundational conflict between classic
  vs. societal metrics using the right predictions. However, the performance evaluation
  of learning-augmented algorithms calls for a new set of technical questions, which
  we highlight in this paper.
