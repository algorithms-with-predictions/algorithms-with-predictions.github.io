title: Decision-Theoretic Approaches for Improved Learning-Augmented Algorithms
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos, Christoph Durr, Georgii Melidi
abstract: We initiate the systematic study of decision-theoretic metrics in the design
  and analysis of algorithms with machine-learned predictions. We introduce approaches
  based on both deterministic measures such as distance-based evaluation, that help
  us quantify how close the algorithm is to an ideal solution, and stochastic measures
  that balance the trade-off between the algorithm's performance and the risk associated
  with the imperfect oracle. These approaches allow us to quantify the algorithm's
  performance across the full spectrum of the prediction error, and thus choose the
  best algorithm within an entire class of otherwise incomparable ones. We apply our
  framework to three well-known problems from online decision making, namely ski-rental,
  one-max search, and contract scheduling.
