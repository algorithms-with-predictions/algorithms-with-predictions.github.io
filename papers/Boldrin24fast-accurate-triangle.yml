title: Fast and Accurate Triangle Counting in Graph Streams Using Predictions
authors: Boldrin, Vandin
abstract: In this work, we present the first efficient and practical algorithm for
  estimating the number of triangles in a graph stream using predictions. Our algorithm
  combines waiting room sampling and reservoir sampling with a predictor for the heaviness
  of edges, that is, the number of triangles in which an edge is involved. As a result,
  our algorithm is fast, provides guarantees on the amount of memory used, and exploits
  the additional information provided by the predictor to produce highly accurate
  estimates. We also propose a simple and domain-independent predictor, based on the
  degree of nodes, that can be easily computed with one pass on a stream of edges
  when the stream is available beforehand. Our analytical results show that, when
  the predictor provides useful information on the heaviness of edges, it leads to
  estimates with reduced variance compared to the state-of-the-art, even when the
  predictions are far from perfect. Our experimental results show that, when analyzing
  a single graph stream, our algorithm is faster than the state-of-the-art for a given
  memory budget, while providing significantly more accurate estimates. Even more
  interestingly, when sequences of hundreds of graph streams are analyzed, our algorithm
  significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art using our simple degree-based predictor
  built by analyzing only the first graph of the sequence.
