title: Multi-Platform Autobidding with and without Predictions

abstract: 'We study the problem of finding the optimal bidding strategy for an advertiser
  in a multi-platform auction setting. The competition on a platform is captured by
  a value and a cost function, mapping bidding strategies to value and cost respectively.
  We assume a diminishing returns property, whereby the marginal cost is increasing
  in value. The advertiser uses an autobidder that selects a bidding strategy for
  each platform, aiming to maximize total value subject to budget and return-on-spend
  constraint. The advertiser has no prior information and learns about the value and
  cost functions by querying a platform with a specific bidding strategy. Our goal
  is to design algorithms that find the optimal bidding strategy with a small number
  of queries. We first present an algorithm that requires (O(m log (mn) log n)) queries,
  where m is the number of platforms and n is the number of possible bidding strategies
  in each platform. Moreover, we adopt the learning-augmented framework and propose
  an algorithm that utilizes a (possibly erroneous) prediction of the optimal bidding
  strategy. We provide a O(m log (mη) log η) query-complexity bound on our algorithm
  as a function of the prediction error η. This guarantee gracefully degrades to (O(m
  log (mn) log n)). This achieves a "best-of-both-worlds" scenario: (O(m)) queries
  when given a correct prediction, and (O(m log (mn) log n)) even for an arbitrary
  incorrect prediction.'
