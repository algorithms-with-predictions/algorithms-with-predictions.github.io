title: Warm-starting Push-Relabel
authors: Sami Davies, Sergei Vassilvitskii, Yuyan Wang
abstract: Push-Relabel is one of the most celebrated network flow algorithms. Maintaining
  a pre-flow that saturates a cut, it enjoys better theoretical and empirical running
  time than other flow algorithms, such as Ford-Fulkerson. In practice, Push-Relabel
  is even faster than what theoretical guarantees can promise, in part because of
  the use of good heuristics for seeding and updating the iterative algorithm. However,
  it remains unclear how to run Push-Relabel on an arbitrary initialization that is
  not necessarily a pre-flow or cut-saturating. We provide the first theoretical guarantees
  for warm-starting Push-Relabel with a predicted flow, where our learning-augmented
  version benefits from fast running time when the predicted flow is close to an optimal
  flow, while maintaining robust worst-case guarantees. Interestingly, our algorithm
  uses the gap relabeling heuristic, which has long been employed in practice, even
  though prior to our work there was no rigorous theoretical justification for why
  it can lead to run-time improvements. We then provide experiments that show our
  warm-started Push-Relabel also works well in practice.
