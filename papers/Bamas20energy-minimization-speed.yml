title: Learning Augmented Energy Minimization via Speed Scaling
authors: Étienne Bamas, Andreas Maggiori, Lars Rohwedder, Ola Svensson
abstract: As power management has become a primary concern in modern data centers, computing resources are being scaled dynamically
  to minimize energy consumption. We initiate the study of a variant of the classic online speed scaling problem, in which
  machine learning predictions about the future can be integrated naturally. Inspired by recent work on learning-augmented
  online algorithms, we propose an algorithm which incorporates predictions in a black-box manner and outperforms any online
  algorithm if the accuracy is high, yet maintains provable guarantees if the prediction is very inaccurate. We provide both
  theoretical and experimental evidence to support our claims.
