title: Permutation Predictions for Non-Clairvoyant Scheduling
authors: Alexander Lindermayr, Nicole Megow
abstract: In non-clairvoyant scheduling, the task is to find an online strategy for
  scheduling jobs with a priori unknown processing requirements with the objective
  to minimize the total (weighted) completion time. We revisit this well-studied problem
  in a recently popular learning-augmented setting that integrates (untrusted) predictions
  in online algorithm design. While previous works used predictions on processing
  requirements, we propose a new prediction model, which provides a relative order
  of jobs which could be seen as predicting algorithmic actions rather than parts
  of the unknown input. We show that these predictions have desired properties, admit
  a natural error measure as well as algorithms with strong performance guarantees
  and that they are learnable in both, theory and practice. We generalize the algorithmic
  framework proposed in the seminal paper by Kumar et al. (NeurIPS'18) and present
  the first learning-augmented scheduling results for weighted jobs and unrelated
  machines. We demonstrate in empirical experiments the practicability and superior
  performance compared to the previously suggested single-machine algorithms.
