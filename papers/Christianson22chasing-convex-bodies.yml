title: Chasing Convex Bodies and Functions with Black-Box Advice
authors: Christianson, Handina, Wierman
abstract: We consider the problem of convex function chasing with black-box advice,
  where an online decision-maker aims to minimize the total cost of making and switching
  between decisions in a normed vector space, aided by black-box advice such as the
  decisions of a machine-learned algorithm. The decision-maker seeks cost comparable
  to the advice when it performs well, known as $\textit{consistency}$, while also
  ensuring worst-case $\textit{robustness}$ even when the advice is adversarial. We
  first consider the common paradigm of algorithms that switch between the decisions
  of the advice and a competitive algorithm, showing that no algorithm in this class
  can improve upon 3-consistency while staying robust. We then propose two novel algorithms
  that bypass this limitation by exploiting the problem's convexity. The first, INTERP,
  achieves $(\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$-consistency and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{C}{\epsilon^2})$-robustness
  for any $\epsilon>0$, where $C$ is the competitive ratio of an algorithm for convex
  function chasing or a subclass thereof. The second, BDINTERP, achieves $(1+\epsilon)$-consistency
  and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{CD}{\epsilon})$-robustness when the problem has bounded diameter
  $D$. Further, we show that BDINTERP achieves near-optimal consistency-robustness
  trade-off for the special case where cost functions are $\alpha$-polyhedral.
