  Prices"

abstract:
  'We study the dynamic pricing problem with knapsack, addressing the challenge
  of balancing exploration and exploitation under resource constraints. We introduce
  three algorithms tailored to different informational settings: a Boundary Attracted
  Re-solve Method for full information, an online learning algorithm for scenarios
  with no prior information, and an estimate-then-select re-solve algorithm that leverages
  machine-learned informed prices with known upper bound of estimation errors. The
  Boundary Attracted Re-solve Method achieves logarithmic regret without requiring
  the non-degeneracy condition, while the online learning algorithm attains an optimal
  $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our estimate-then-select approach bridges the gap between
  these settings, providing improved regret bounds when reliable offline data is available.
  Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms
  across various scenarios. This work advances the understanding of online resource
  allocation and dynamic pricing, offering practical solutions adaptable to different
  informational structures.'
