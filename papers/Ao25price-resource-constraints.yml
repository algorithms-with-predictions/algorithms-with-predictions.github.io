title: 'Learning to Price with Resource Constraints: From Full Information to Machine-Learned Prices'
authors: Ruicheng Ao, Jiashuo Jiang, David Simchi-Levi
abstract: 'We study the dynamic pricing problem with knapsack, addressing the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation
  under resource constraints. We introduce three algorithms tailored to different informational settings: a Boundary Attracted
  Re-solve Method for full information, an online learning algorithm for scenarios with no prior information, and an estimate-then-select
  re-solve algorithm that leverages machine-learned informed prices with known upper bound of estimation errors. The Boundary
  Attracted Re-solve Method achieves logarithmic regret without requiring the non-degeneracy condition, while the online learning
  algorithm attains an optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our estimate-then-select approach bridges the gap between these settings,
  providing improved regret bounds when reliable offline data is available. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness
  and robustness of our algorithms across various scenarios. This work advances the understanding of online resource allocation
  and dynamic pricing, offering practical solutions adaptable to different informational structures.'
