abstract: An important goal of modern scheduling systems is to efficiently manage power usage. In energy-efficient scheduling,
  the operating system controls the speed at which a machine is processing jobs with the dual objective of minimizing energy
  consumption and optimizing the quality of service cost of the resulting schedule. Since machine-learned predictions about
  future requests can often be learned from historical data, a recent line of work on learning-augmented algorithms aims to
  achieve improved performance guarantees by leveraging predictions. In particular, for energy-efficient scheduling, Bamas
  et. al. [BamasMRS20] and Antoniadis et. al. [antoniadis2021novel] designed algorithms with predictions for the energy minimization
  with deadlines problem and achieved an improved competitive ratio when the prediction error is small while also maintaining
  worst-case bounds even when the prediction error is arbitrarily large. In this paper, we consider a general setting for
  energy-efficient scheduling and provide a flexible learning-augmented algorithmic framework that takes as input an offline
  and an online algorithm for the desired energy-efficient scheduling problem. We show that, when the prediction error is
  small, this framework gives improved competitive ratios for many different energy-efficient scheduling problems, including
  energy minimization with deadlines, while also maintaining a bounded competitive ratio regardless of the prediction error.
  Finally, we empirically demonstrate that this framework achieves an improved performance on real and synthetic datasets.
