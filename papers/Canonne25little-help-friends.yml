title: 'With a Little Help From My Friends: Exploiting Probability Distribution Advice in Algorithm Design'
authors: Clément L. Canonne, Kenny Chen, Julián Mestre
abstract: We study online algorithms with predictions using distributional advice, a type of prediction that arises when leveraging
  expert knowledge or historical data. To demonstrate the usefulness and versatility of this framework, we focus on the fundamental
  problem of online metric matching, considering both the fractional and integral variants. Our main positive result is, for
  the former, an algorithm achieving the optimal cost under perfect advice, while smoothly defaulting to competitive ratios
  comparable to advice-free algorithms as the prediction's quality degrades. For the integral matching, we are able to provide
  an algorithm with essentially the same guarantees, up to an additive sublinear term. We conclude by discussing how our algorithmic
  framework can be extended to other online optimization problems.
