title: Online Bin Covering with Frequency Predictions
authors: Berg, Kamali
abstract: We study the discrete bin covering problem where a multiset of items from
  a fixed set $S \subseteq (0,1]$ must be split into disjoint subsets while maximizing
  the number of subsets whose contents sum to at least $1$. We study the online discrete
  variant, where $S$ is finite, and items arrive sequentially. In the purely online
  setting, we show that the competitive ratios of best deterministic (and randomized)
  algorithms converge to $\frac{1}{2}$ for large $S$, similar to the continuous setting.
  Therefore, we consider the problem under the prediction setting, where algorithms
  may access a vector of frequencies predicting the frequency of items of each size
  in the instance. In this setting, we introduce a family of online algorithms that
  perform near-optimally when the predictions are correct. Further, we introduce a
  second family of more robust algorithms that presents a tradeoff between the performance
  guarantees when the predictions are perfect and when predictions are adversarial.
  Finally, we consider a stochastic setting where items are drawn independently from
  any fixed but unknown distribution of $S$. Using results from the PAC-learnability
  of probabilities in discrete distributions, we also introduce a purely online algorithm
  whose average-case performance is near-optimal with high probability for all finite
  sets $S$ and all distributions of $S$.
