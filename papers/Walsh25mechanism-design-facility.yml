title: Mechanism Design for Facility Location using Predictions
authors: Toby Walsh
abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions
  of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which
  considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and the minimum
  utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that
  just considers the maximum distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance
  in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate) and robustness
  (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms
  with predictions can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust.
  Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency.
  We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms
  for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two
  predictions for where to locate the two facilities.
