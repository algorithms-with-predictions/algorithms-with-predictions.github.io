title: Mechanism Design for Facility Location using Predictions
authors: Toby Walsh
abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions of the optimal facility location.
  We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and
  the minimum utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum
  distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate)
  and robustness (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions
  can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to
  trade robustness for consistency. We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms
  for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two predictions for where to locate the two
  facilities.
