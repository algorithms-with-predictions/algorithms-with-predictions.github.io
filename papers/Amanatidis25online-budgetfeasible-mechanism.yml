abstract: Augmenting the input of algorithms with predictions is an algorithm design
  paradigm that suggests leveraging a (possibly erroneous) prediction to improve worst-case
  performance guarantees when the prediction is perfect (consistency), while also
  providing a performance guarantee when the prediction fails (robustness). Recently,
  Xu and Lu [2022] and Agrawal et al. [2024] proposed to consider settings with strategic
  agents under this framework. In this paper, we initiate the study of budget-feasible
  mechanism design with predictions. These mechanisms model a procurement auction
  scenario in which an auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint seeks to
  purchase goods or services from a set of strategic agents, so as to maximize her
  own valuation function. We focus on the online version of the problem where the
  arrival order of agents is random. We design mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible,
  and achieve a significantly improved competitive ratio for both monotone and non-monotone
  submodular valuation functions compared to their state-of-the-art counterparts without
  predictions. Our results assume access to a prediction for the value of the optimal
  solution to the offline problem. We complement our positive results by showing that
  for the offline version of the problem, access to predictions is mostly ineffective
  in improving approximation guarantees.
