authors: Bo Sun, Russell Lee, Mohammad H. Hajiesmaili, Adam Wierman, Danny H. K. Tsang
abstract: This paper leverages machine-learned predictions to design competitive algorithms for online conversion problems
  with the goal of improving the competitive ratio when predictions are accurate (i.e., consistency), while also guaranteeing
  a worst-case competitive ratio regardless of the prediction quality (i.e., robustness). We unify the algorithmic design
  of both integral and fractional conversion problems, which are also known as the 1-max-search and one-way trading problems,
  into a class of online threshold-based algorithms (OTA). By incorporating predictions into design of OTA, we achieve the
  Pareto-optimal trade-off of consistency and robustness, i.e., no online algorithm can achieve a better consistency guarantee
  given for a robustness guarantee. We demonstrate the performance of OTA using numerical experiments on Bitcoin conversion.
