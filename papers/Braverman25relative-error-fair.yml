abstract: 'We study fair clustering problems in a setting where distance information is obtained from two sources: a strong
  oracle providing exact distances, but at a high cost, and a weak oracle providing potentially inaccurate distance estimates
  at a low cost. The goal is to produce a near-optimal fair clustering on $n$ input points with a minimum number of strong
  oracle queries. This models the increasingly common trade-off between accurate but expensive similarity measures (e.g.,
  large-scale embeddings) and cheaper but inaccurate alternatives. The study of fair clustering in the model is motivated
  by the important quest of achieving fairness with the presence of inaccurate information. We achieve the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-coresets
  for fair $k$-median clustering using $\text{poly}\left(\frac{k}{\varepsilon}\cdot\log n\right)$ queries to the strong oracle.
  Furthermore, our results imply coresets for the standard setting (without fairness constraints), and we could in fact obtain
  $(1+\varepsilon)$-coresets for $(k,z)$-clustering for general $z=O(1)$ with a similar number of strong oracle queries. In
  contrast, previous results achieved a constant-factor $(>10)$ approximation for the standard $k$-clustering problems, and
  no previous work considered the fair $k$-median clustering problem.'
