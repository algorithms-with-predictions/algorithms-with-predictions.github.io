abstract: 'Imagine you are a computer scientist who enjoys attending conferences or workshops within the year. Sadly, your
  travel budget is limited, so you must select a subset of events you can travel to. When you are aware of all possible events
  and their costs at the beginning of the year, you can select the subset of the possible events that maximizes your happiness
  and is within your budget. On the other hand, if you are blind about the options, you will likely have a hard time when
  trying to decide if you want to register somewhere or not, and will likely regret decisions you made in the future. These
  scenarios can be modeled by knapsack variants, either by an offline or an online problem. However, both scenarios are somewhat
  unrealistic: Usually, you will not know the exact costs of each workshop at the beginning of the year. The online version,
  however, is too pessimistic, as you might already know which options there are and how much they cost roughly. At some point,
  you have to decide whether to register for some workshop, but then you are aware of the conference fee and the flight and
  hotel prices. We model this problem within the setting of online knapsack problems with estimates: in the beginning, you
  receive a list of potential items with their estimated size as well as the accuracy of the estimates. Then, the items are
  revealed one by one in an online fashion with their actual size, and you need to decide whether to take one or not. In this
  article, we show a best-possible algorithm for each estimate accuracy $\delta$ (i.e., when each actual item size can deviate
  by $\pm \delta$ from the announced size) for both the simple knapsack and the simple knapsack with removability.'
