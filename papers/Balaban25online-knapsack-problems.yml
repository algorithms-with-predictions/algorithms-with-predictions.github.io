abstract: 'Imagine you are a computer scientist who enjoys attending conferences or
  workshops within the year. Sadly, your travel budget is limited, so you must select
  a subset of events you can travel to. When you are aware of all possible events
  and their costs at the beginning of the year, you can select the subset of the possible
  events that maximizes your happiness and is within your budget. On the other hand,
  if you are blind about the options, you will likely have a hard time when trying
  to decide if you want to register somewhere or not, and will likely regret decisions
  you made in the future. These scenarios can be modeled by knapsack variants, either
  by an offline or an online problem. However, both scenarios are somewhat unrealistic:
  Usually, you will not know the exact costs of each workshop at the beginning of
  the year. The online version, however, is too pessimistic, as you might already
  know which options there are and how much they cost roughly. At some point, you
  have to decide whether to register for some workshop, but then you are aware of
  the conference fee and the flight and hotel prices. We model this problem within
  the setting of online knapsack problems with estimates: in the beginning, you receive
  a list of potential items with their estimated size as well as the accuracy of the
  estimates. Then, the items are revealed one by one in an online fashion with their
  actual size, and you need to decide whether to take one or not. In this article,
  we show a best-possible algorithm for each estimate accuracy $\delta$ (i.e., when
  each actual item size can deviate by $\pm \delta$ from the announced size) for both
  the simple knapsack and the simple knapsack with removability.'
