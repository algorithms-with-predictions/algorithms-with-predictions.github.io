title: Learning-augmented Maximum Independent Set
authors: Braverman, Dharangutte, Shah, Wang
abstract: We study the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on general graphs within
  the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. The MIS problem is known to be NP-hard
  and is also NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of $n^{1-\delta}$ for any
  $\delta>0$. We show that we can break this barrier in the presence of an oracle
  obtained through predictions from a machine learning model that answers vertex membership
  queries for a fixed MIS with probability $1/2+\varepsilon$. In the first setting
  we consider, the oracle can be queried once per vertex to know if a vertex belongs
  to a fixed MIS, and the oracle returns the correct answer with probability $1/2
  + \varepsilon$. Under this setting, we show an algorithm that obtains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\Delta}/\varepsilon)$-approximation
  in $O(m)$ time where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. In the second
  setting, we allow multiple queries to the oracle for a vertex, each of which is
  correct with probability $1/2 + \varepsilon$. For this setting, we show an $O(1)$-approximation
  algorithm using $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ total queries and $\tilde{O}(m)$ runtime.
