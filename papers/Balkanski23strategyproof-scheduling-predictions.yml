title: Strategyproof Scheduling with Predictions

abstract: 'In their seminal paper that initiated the field of algorithmic mechanism design, \citet{NR99} studied the problem
  of designing strategyproof mechanisms for scheduling jobs on unrelated machines aiming to minimize the makespan. They provided
  a strategyproof mechanism that achieves an $n$-approximation and they made the bold conjecture that this is the best approximation
  achievable by any deterministic strategyproof scheduling mechanism. After more than two decades and several efforts, $n$
  remains the best known approximation and very recent work by \citet{CKK21} has been able to prove an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
  approximation lower bound for all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. This strong negative result, however, heavily
  depends on the fact that the performance of these mechanisms is evaluated using worst-case analysis. To overcome such overly
  pessimistic, and often uninformative, worst-case bounds, a surge of recent work has focused on the ``learning-augmented
  framework'''', whose goal is to leverage machine-learned predictions to obtain improved approximations when these predictions
  are accurate (consistency), while also achieving near-optimal worst-case approximations even when the predictions are arbitrarily
  wrong (robustness). In this work, we study the classic strategic scheduling problem of~\citet{NR99} using the learning-augmented
  framework and give a deterministic polynomial-time strategyproof mechanism that is $6$-consistent and $2n$-robust. We thus
  achieve the ``best of both worlds'''': an $O(1)$ consistency and an $O(n)$ robustness that asymptotically matches the best-known
  approximation. We then extend this result to provide more general worst-case approximation guarantees as a function of the
  prediction error. Finally, we complement our positive results by showing that any $1$-consistent deterministic strategyproof
  mechanism has unbounded robustness.'
