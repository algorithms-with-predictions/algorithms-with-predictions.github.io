abstract: 'We study truthful mechanisms for approximating the Maximin-Share (MMS) allocation of agents with additive valuations
  for indivisible goods. Algorithmically, constant factor approximations exist for the problem for any number of agents. When
  adding incentives to the mix, a jarring result by Amanatidis, Birmpas, Christodoulou, and Markakis [EC 2017] shows that
  the best possible approximation for two agents and $m$ items is $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$. We adopt a learning-augmented
  framework to investigate what is possible when some prediction on the input is given. For two agents, we give a truthful
  mechanism that takes agents'' ordering over items as prediction. When the prediction is accurate, we give a $2$-approximation
  to the MMS (consistency), and when the prediction is off, we still get an $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$-approximation to the
  MMS (robustness). We further show that the mechanism''s performance degrades gracefully in the number of ``mistakes"in the
  prediction; i.e., we interpolate (up to constant factors) between the two extremes: when there are no mistakes, and when
  there is a maximum number of mistakes. We also show an impossibility result on the obtainable consistency for mechanisms
  with finite robustness. For the general case of $n\ge 2$ agents, we give a 2-approximation mechanism for accurate predictions,
  with relaxed fallback guarantees. Finally, we give experimental results which illustrate when different components of our
  framework, made to insure consistency and robustness, come into play.'
