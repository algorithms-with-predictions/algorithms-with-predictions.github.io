abstract:
  Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
  answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized algorithms}
  (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established theoretical understanding.
  VAs decompose a task into simple elementary operations on natural language strings
  that they should be able to answer reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only
  those simple tasks. For example, for sorting a series of natural language strings,
  \emph{verbalized sorting} uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and
  well-analyzed sorting algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.
