abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right answer for a reasoning task, we propose
  a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established theoretical
  understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary operations on natural language strings that they should be able
  to answer reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example, for sorting a series of natural
  language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting} uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
  algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.
