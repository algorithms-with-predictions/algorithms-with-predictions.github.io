title: Online Prediction in Sub-linear Space
authors: Binghui Peng, Fred Zhang
abstract: We provide the first sub-linear space and sub-linear regret algorithm for online learning with expert advice (against
  an oblivious adversary), addressing an open question raised recently by Srinivas, Woodruff, Xu and Zhou (STOC 2022). We
  also demonstrate a separation between oblivious and (strong) adaptive adversaries by proving a linear memory lower bound
  of any sub-linear regret algorithm against an adaptive adversary. Our algorithm is based on a novel pool selection procedure
  that bypasses the traditional wisdom of leader selection for online learning, and a generic reduction that transforms any
  weakly sub-linear regret $o(T)$ algorithm to $T^{1-\alpha}$ regret algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Our
  lower bound utilizes the connection of no-regret learning and equilibrium computation in zero-sum games, leading to a proof
  of a strong lower bound against an adaptive adversary.
