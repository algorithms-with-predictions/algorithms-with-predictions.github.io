abstract: We initiate the study of online routing problems with predictions, inspired by recent exciting results in the area
  of learning-augmented algorithms. A learning-augmented online algorithm which incorporates predictions in a black-box manner
  to outperform existing algorithms if the predictions are accurate while otherwise maintaining theoretical guarantees even
  when the predictions are extremely erroneous is a popular framework for overcoming pessimistic worst-case competitive analysis.
  In this study, we particularly begin investigating the classical online traveling salesman problem (OLTSP), where future
  requests are augmented with predictions. Unlike the prediction models in other previous studies, each actual request in
  the OLTSP, associated with its arrival time and position, may not coincide with the predicted ones, which, as imagined,
  leads to a troublesome situation. Our main result is to study different prediction models and design algorithms to improve
  the best-known results in the different settings. Moreover, we generalize the proposed results to the online dial-a-ride
  problem.
