title: Online TSP with Predictions
authors: Hu, Wei, Li, Chung, Liao
abstract: We initiate the study of online routing problems with predictions, inspired
  by recent exciting results in the area of learning-augmented algorithms. A learning-augmented
  online algorithm which incorporates predictions in a black-box manner to outperform
  existing algorithms if the predictions are accurate while otherwise maintaining
  theoretical guarantees even when the predictions are extremely erroneous is a popular
  framework for overcoming pessimistic worst-case competitive analysis. In this study,
  we particularly begin investigating the classical online traveling salesman problem
  (OLTSP), where future requests are augmented with predictions. Unlike the prediction
  models in other previous studies, each actual request in the OLTSP, associated with
  its arrival time and position, may not coincide with the predicted ones, which,
  as imagined, leads to a troublesome situation. Our main result is to study different
  prediction models and design algorithms to improve the best-known results in the
  different settings. Moreover, we generalize the proposed results to the online dial-a-ride
  problem.
