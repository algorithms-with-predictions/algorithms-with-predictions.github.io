abstract: Uncertain perturbations in dynamical systems often arise from diverse resources, represented by latent components.
  The predictions for these components, typically generated by “black-box” machine learning tools, are prone to inaccuracies.
  To tackle this challenge, we introduce D ISC , a novel policy that learns a confidence parameter online to harness the potential
  of accurate predictions while also mitigating the impact of erroneous forecasts. When predictions are precise, D ISC leverages
  this information to achieve near-optimal performance. Conversely, in the case of significant prediction errors, it still
  has a worst-case competitive ratio guarantee. We provide competitive ratio bounds for D ISC under both linear mixing of
  latent variables as well as a broader class of mixing functions. Our results highlight a first-of-its-kind “best-of-both-worlds”
  integration of machine-learned predictions, thus lead to a near-optimal consistency and robustness tradeoff, which provably
  improves what can be obtained without learning the confidence parameter. We validate the applicability of D ISC across a
  spectrum of practical scenarios.
