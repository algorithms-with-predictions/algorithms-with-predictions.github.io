title: Competitive Sequencing with Noisy Advice
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos, Diogo Arsénio, Shahin Kamali
abstract: 'Several well-studied online resource allocation problems can be formulated in terms of infinite, increasing sequences
  of positive values, in which each element is associated with a corresponding allocation value. Examples include problems
  such as online bidding, searching for a hidden target on an unbounded line, and designing interruptible algorithms based
  on repeated executions. The performance of the online algorithm, in each of these problems, is measured by the competitive
  ratio, which describes the multiplicative performance loss due to the absence of full information on the instance. We study
  such competitive sequencing problems in a setting in which the online algorithm has some (potentially) erroneous information,
  expressed as a $k$-bit advice string, for some given $k$. We first consider the untrusted advice setting of [Angelopoulos
  et al, ITCS 2020], in which the objective is to quantify performance considering two extremes: either the advice is either
  error-free, or it is generated by a (malicious) adversary. Here, we show a Pareto-optimal solution, using a new approach
  for applying the functional-based lower-bound technique due to [Gal, Israel J. Math. 1972]. Next, we study a nascent noisy
  advice setting, in which a number of the advice bits may be erroneous; the exact error is unknown to the online algorithm,
  which only has access to a pessimistic estimate (i.e., an upper bound on this error). We give improved upper bounds, but
  also the first lower bound on the competitive ratio of an online problem in this setting. To this end, we combine ideas
  from robust query-based search in arrays, and fault-tolerant contract scheduling. Last, we demonstrate how to apply the
  above techniques in robust optimization without predictions, and discuss how they can be applicable in the context of more
  general online problems.'
