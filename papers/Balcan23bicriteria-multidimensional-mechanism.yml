title: Bicriteria Multidimensional Mechanism Design with Side Information
authors: Balcan, Prasad, Sandholm
abstract: We develop a versatile methodology for multidimensional mechanism design
  that incorporates side information about agents to generate high welfare and high
  revenue simultaneously. Side information sources include advice from domain experts,
  predictions from machine learning models, and even the mechanism designer's gut
  instinct. We design a tunable mechanism that integrates side information with an
  improved VCG-like mechanism based on weakest types, which are agent types that generate
  the least welfare. We show that our mechanism, when carefully tuned, generates welfare
  and revenue competitive with the prior-free total social surplus, and its performance
  decays gracefully as the side information quality decreases. We consider a number
  of side information formats including distribution-free predictions, predictions
  that express uncertainty, agent types constrained to low-dimensional subspaces of
  the ambient type space, and the traditional setting with known priors over agent
  types. In each setting we design mechanisms based on weakest types and prove performance
  guarantees.
