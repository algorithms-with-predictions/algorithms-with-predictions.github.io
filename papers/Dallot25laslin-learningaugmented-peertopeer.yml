abstract: 'We introduce a learning-augmented peer-to-peer (P2P) network design that leverages the predictions of traffic patterns
  to optimize the network''s topology. While keeping formal guarantees on the standard P2P metrics (routing path length, maximum
  degree), we optimize the network in a demand-aware manner and minimize the path lengths weighted by the peer-to-peer communication
  demands. Our protocol is learning-augmented, meaning that each node receives an individual, possibly inaccurate prediction
  about the future traffic patterns, with the goal of improving the network''s performances. We strike a trade-off between
  significantly improved performances when the predictions are correct (consistency) and polylogarithmic performances when
  the predictions are arbitrary (robustness). We have two main contributions. First, we consider the centralized setting and
  show that the problem of constructing an optimum static skip list network (SLN) is solvable in polynomial time and can be
  computed via dynamic programming. This problem is the natural demand-aware extension of the optimal skip list problem. Second,
  we introduce the Uniform P2P protocol which generalizes skip list networks (SLN) by relaxing the node''s heights from discrete
  to continuous. We show that Uniform achieves state-of-the-art performances: logarithmic routing and maximum degree, both
  with high probability. We then use Uniform to build a learning-augmented P2P protocol in order to incorporate demand-awareness,
  leading to our main contribution, LASLiN. We prove that the performances of LASLiN are consistent with those of an optimum
  static SLN with correct predictions (given via our dynamic programming approach), and are at most a logarithmic factor off
  the state-of-the-art P2P protocols if the predictions are arbitrary wrong. For the special case of highly sparse demands,
  we show that LASLiN achieves improved performances.'
