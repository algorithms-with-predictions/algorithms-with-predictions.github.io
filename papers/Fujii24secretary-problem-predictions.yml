title: The Secretary Problem with Predictions
authors: Kaito Fujii, Yuichi Yoshida
abstract: 'The value maximization version of the secretary problem is the problem of hiring a candidate with the largest value
  from a randomly ordered sequence of candidates. In this work, we consider a setting where predictions of candidate values
  are provided in advance. We propose an algorithm that achieves a nearly optimal value if the predictions are accurate and
  results in a constant-factor competitive ratio otherwise. We also show that the worst-case competitive ratio of an algorithm
  cannot be higher than some constant [Formula: see text], which is the best possible competitive ratio when we ignore predictions,
  if the algorithm performs nearly optimally when the predictions are accurate. Additionally, for the multiple-choice secretary
  problem, we propose an algorithm with a similar theoretical guarantee. We empirically illustrate that if the predictions
  are accurate, the proposed algorithms perform well; meanwhile, if the predictions are inaccurate, performance is comparable
  to existing algorithms that do not use predictions.'
