title: Learning-Based Algorithms for Graph Searching Problems
authors: A. DePavia, Erasmo Tani, A. Vakilian
abstract: We consider the problem of graph searching with prediction recently introduced
  by Banerjee et al. (2022). In this problem, an agent, starting at some vertex $r$
  has to traverse a (potentially unknown) graph $G$ to find a hidden goal node $g$
  while minimizing the total distance travelled. We study a setting in which at any
  node $v$, the agent receives a noisy estimate of the distance from $v$ to $g$. We
  design algorithms for this search task on unknown graphs. We establish the first
  formal guarantees on unknown weighted graphs and provide lower bounds showing that
  the algorithms we propose have optimal or nearly-optimal dependence on the prediction
  error. Further, we perform numerical experiments demonstrating that in addition
  to being robust to adversarial error, our algorithms perform well in typical instances
  in which the error is stochastic. Finally, we provide alternative simpler performance
  bounds on the algorithms of Banerjee et al. (2022) for the case of searching on
  a known graph, and establish new lower bounds for this setting.
