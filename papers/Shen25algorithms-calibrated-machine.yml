title: Algorithms with Calibrated Machine Learning Predictions
authors: Judy Hanwen Shen, Ellen Vitercik, Anders Wikum
abstract: 'The field of algorithms with predictions incorporates machine learning advice in the design of online algorithms
  to improve real-world performance. A central consideration is the extent to which predictions can be trusted -- while existing
  approaches often require users to specify an aggregate trust level, modern machine learning models can provide estimates
  of prediction-level uncertainty. In this paper, we propose calibration as a principled and practical tool to bridge this
  gap, demonstrating the benefits of calibrated advice through two case studies: the ski rental and online job scheduling
  problems. For ski rental, we design an algorithm that achieves near-optimal prediction-dependent performance and prove that,
  in high-variance settings, calibrated advice offers more effective guidance than alternative methods for uncertainty quantification.
  For job scheduling, we demonstrate that using a calibrated predictor leads to significant performance improvements over
  existing methods. Evaluations on real-world data validate our theoretical findings, highlighting the practical impact of
  calibration for algorithms with predictions.'
