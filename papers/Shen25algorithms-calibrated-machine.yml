title: Algorithms with Calibrated Machine Learning Predictions
authors: Judy Hanwen Shen, Ellen Vitercik, Anders Wikum
abstract: 'The field of algorithms with predictions incorporates machine learning
  advice in the design of online algorithms to improve real-world performance. A central
  consideration is the extent to which predictions can be trusted -- while existing
  approaches often require users to specify an aggregate trust level, modern machine
  learning models can provide estimates of prediction-level uncertainty. In this paper,
  we propose calibration as a principled and practical tool to bridge this gap, demonstrating
  the benefits of calibrated advice through two case studies: the ski rental and online
  job scheduling problems. For ski rental, we design an algorithm that achieves near-optimal
  prediction-dependent performance and prove that, in high-variance settings, calibrated
  advice offers more effective guidance than alternative methods for uncertainty quantification.
  For job scheduling, we demonstrate that using a calibrated predictor leads to significant
  performance improvements over existing methods. Evaluations on real-world data validate
  our theoretical findings, highlighting the practical impact of calibration for algorithms
  with predictions.'
