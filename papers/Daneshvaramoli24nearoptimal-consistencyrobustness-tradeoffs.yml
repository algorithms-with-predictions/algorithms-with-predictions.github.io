abstract: This paper introduces a family of learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack problems that achieve near Pareto-optimal
  consistency-robustness trade-offs through a simple combination of trusted learning-augmented and worst-case algorithms.
  Our approach relies on succinct, practical predictions -- single values or intervals estimating the minimum value of any
  item in an offline solution. Additionally, we propose a novel fractional-to-integral conversion procedure, offering new
  insights for online algorithm design.
