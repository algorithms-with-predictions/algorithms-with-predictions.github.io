title: Online Algorithms with Multiple Predictions
authors: Keerti Anand, Rong Ge, Amit Kumar, Debmalya Panigrahi
abstract: This paper studies online algorithms augmented with multiple machine-learned predictions. While online algorithms
  augmented with a single prediction have been extensively studied in recent years, the literature for the multiple predictions
  setting is sparse. In this paper, we give a generic algorithmic framework for online covering problems with multiple predictions
  that obtains an online solution that is competitive against the performance of the best predictor. Our algorithm incorporates
  the use of predictions in the classic potential-based analysis of online algorithms. We apply our algorithmic framework
  to solve classical problems such as online set cover, (weighted) caching, and online facility location in the multiple predictions
  setting. Our algorithm can also be robustified, i.e., the algorithm can be simultaneously made competitive against the best
  prediction and the performance of the best online algorithm (without prediction).
