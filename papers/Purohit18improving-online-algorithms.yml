title: Improving online algorithms via ML predictions
authors: Ravi Kumar, Manish Purohit, Zoya Svitkina
abstract: In this work we study the problem of using machine-learned predictions to improve performance of online algorithms.
  We consider two classical problems, ski rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling, and obtain new online algorithms that
  use predictions to make their decisions. These algorithms are oblivious to the performance of the predictor, improve with
  better predictions, but do not degrade much if the predictions are poor.
