title: Improving online algorithms via ML predictions
authors: Purohit, Svitkina, Kumar
abstract: In this work we study the problem of using machine-learned predictions to
  improve performance of online algorithms. We consider two classical problems, ski
  rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling, and obtain new online algorithms that
  use predictions to make their decisions. These algorithms are oblivious to the performance
  of the predictor, improve with better predictions, but do not degrade much if the
  predictions are poor.
