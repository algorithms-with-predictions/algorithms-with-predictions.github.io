title: Learning-Augmented Algorithms with Explicit Predictors
authors: Marek Eliás, Haim Kaplan, Yishay Mansour, Shay Moran
abstract: Recent advances in algorithmic design show how to utilize predictions obtained by machine learning models from past
  and present data. These approaches have demonstrated an enhancement in performance when the predictions are accurate, while
  also ensuring robustness by providing worst-case guarantees when predictions fail. In this paper we focus on online problems;
  prior research in this context was focused on a paradigm where the predictor is pre-trained on past data and then used as
  a black box (to get the predictions it was trained for). In contrast, in this work, we unpack the predictor and integrate
  the learning problem it gives rise for within the algorithmic challenge. In particular we allow the predictor to learn as
  it receives larger parts of the input, with the ultimate goal of designing online learning algorithms specifically tailored
  for the algorithmic task at hand. Adopting this perspective, we focus on a number of fundamental problems, including caching
  and scheduling, which have been well-studied in the black-box setting. For each of the problems we consider, we introduce
  new algorithms that take advantage of explicit learning algorithms which we carefully design towards optimizing the overall
  performance. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by deriving performance bounds which improve over those established
  in previous work.
