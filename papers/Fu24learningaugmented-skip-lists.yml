abstract: We study the integration of machine learning advice to improve upon traditional data structure designed for efficient
  search queries. Although there has been recent effort in improving the performance of binary search trees using machine
  learning advice, e.g., Lin et. al. (ICML 2022), the resulting constructions nevertheless suffer from inherent weaknesses
  of binary search trees, such as complexity of maintaining balance across multiple updates and the inability to handle partially-ordered
  or high-dimensional datasets. For these reasons, we focus on skip lists and KD trees in this work. Given access to a possibly
  erroneous oracle that outputs estimated fractional frequencies for search queries on a set of items, we construct skip lists
  and KD trees that provably provides the optimal expected search time, within nearly a factor of two. In fact, our learning-augmented
  skip lists and KD trees are still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant
  factor. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structures achieves an expected search time that is within
  a constant factor of an oblivious skip list/KD tree construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect. Finally,
  we empirically show that our learning-augmented search data structures outperforms their corresponding traditional analogs
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
