abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each
  interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is
  to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted
  intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where
  the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design
  algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining
  robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors. Our main contribution is
  the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining
  prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies
  to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between
  consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance
  under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness
  of this framework in particular settings. We further design a randomized algorithm
  that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This
  algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully
  with the quality of the prediction.
