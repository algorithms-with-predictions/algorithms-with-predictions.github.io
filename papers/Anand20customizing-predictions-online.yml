title: Customizing ML Predictions For Online Algorithms
authors: Anand, Ge, Panigrahi
abstract: 'A popular line of recent research incorporates ML advice in the design
  of online algorithms to improve their performance in typical instances. These papers
  treat the ML algorithm as a black-box, and redesign online algorithms to take advantage
  of ML predictions. In this paper, we ask the complementary question: can we redesign
  ML algorithms to provide better predictions for online algorithms? We explore this
  question in the context of the classic rent-or-buy problem, and show that incorporating
  optimization benchmarks in ML loss functions leads to signiﬁcantly better performance,
  while maintaining a worst-case adversarial result when the advice is completely
  wrong. We support this ﬁnding both through theoretical bounds and numerical simulations.'
