title: 'Rethinking Warm-Starts with Predictions: Learning Predictions Close to Sets
  of Optimal Solutions for Faster L-/L-Convex Function Minimization'
authors: Sakaue, Oki
abstract: An emerging line of work has shown that machine-learned predictions are
  useful to warm-start algorithms for discrete optimization problems, such as bipartite
  matching. Previous studies have shown time complexity bounds proportional to some
  distance between a prediction and an optimal solution, which we can approximately
  minimize by learning predictions from past optimal solutions. However, such guarantees
  may not be meaningful when multiple optimal solutions exist. Indeed, the dual problem
  of bipartite matching and, more generally, $\text{L}$-/$\text{L}^\natural$-convex
  function minimization have arbitrarily many optimal solutions, making such prediction-dependent
  bounds arbitrarily large. To resolve this theoretically critical issue, we present
  a new warm-start-with-prediction framework for $\text{L}$-/$\text{L}^\natural$-convex
  function minimization. Our framework offers time complexity bounds proportional
  to the distance between a prediction and the set of all optimal solutions. The main
  technical difficulty lies in learning predictions that are provably close to sets
  of all optimal solutions, for which we present an online-gradient-descent-based
  method. We thus give the first polynomial-time learnability of predictions that
  can provably warm-start algorithms regardless of multiple optimal solutions.
