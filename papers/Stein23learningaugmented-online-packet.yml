title: Learning-Augmented Online Packet Scheduling with Deadlines
authors: Stein, Wei
abstract: The modern network aims to prioritize critical traffic over non-critical
  traffic and effectively manage traffic flow. This necessitates proper buffer management
  to prevent the loss of crucial traffic while minimizing the impact on non-critical
  traffic. Therefore, the algorithm's objective is to control which packets to transmit
  and which to discard at each step. In this study, we initiate the learning-augmented
  online packet scheduling with deadlines and provide a novel algorithmic framework
  to cope with the prediction. We show that when the prediction error is small, our
  algorithm improves the competitive ratio while still maintaining a bounded competitive
  ratio, regardless of the prediction error.
