title: Learning-Based Low-Rank Approximations
authors: Piotr Indyk, Ali Vakilian, Yang Yuan
abstract: 'We introduce a “learning-based” algorithm for the low-rank decomposition problem: given an $n \times d$ matrix
  $A$, and a parameter $k$, compute a rank-$k$ matrix $A''$ that minimizes the approximation loss $\|A-A''\|_F$. The algorithm
  uses a training set of input matrices in order to optimize its performance. Specifically, some of the most efficient approximate
  algorithms for computing low-rank approximations proceed by computing a projection $SA$, where $S$ is a sparse random $m
  \times n$ “sketching matrix”, and then performing the singular value decomposition of $SA$. We show how to replace the random
  matrix $S$ with a “learned” matrix of the same sparsity to reduce the error. Our experiments show that, for multiple types
  of data sets, a learned sketch matrix can substantially reduce the approximation loss compared to a random matrix $S$, sometimes
  up to one order of magnitude. We also study mixed matrices where only some of the rows are trained and the remaining ones
  are random, and show that matrices still offer improved performance while retaining worst-case guarantees. Finally, to understand
  the theoretical aspects of our approach, we study the special case of $m=1$. In particular, we give an approximation algorithm
  for minimizing the empirical loss, with approximation factor depending on the stable rank of matrices in the training set.
  We also show generalization bounds for the sketch matrix learning problem.'
