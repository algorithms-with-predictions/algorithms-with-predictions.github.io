title: Impartial Selection with Predictions
authors: Javier Cembrano, Felix A. Fischer, Max Klimm
abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical problem with many applications from
  committee selection to AI alignment. As agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent their
  true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent
  this issue by guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. Previous
  research has established strong bounds on the performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate
  the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms
  can be improved if they are given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of nominations. Specifically,
  we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the
  mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when the prediction is inaccurate. For the general
  setting where up to $k$ agents are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a mechanism with
  consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness $1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting
  a single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that $1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing
  $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal consistency can be
  achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.
