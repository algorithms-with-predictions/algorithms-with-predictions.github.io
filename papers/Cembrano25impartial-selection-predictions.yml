title: Impartial Selection with Predictions
authors: Javier Cembrano, Felix A. Fischer, Max Klimm
abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical
  problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As agents
  both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent their true
  opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own chances of selection.
  Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by guaranteeing that the selection of
  an agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. Previous research
  has established strong bounds on the performance of impartial mechanisms, measured
  by their ability to approximate the number of nominations for the most highly nominated
  agents. We study to what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved
  if they are given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of
  nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness of
  such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the mechanisms when
  the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when the prediction is
  inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents are to be selected and
  agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a mechanism with consistency
  $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness $1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$.
  For the special case of selecting a single agent based on a single nomination per
  agent, we prove that $1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness.
  A close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal consistency
  can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.
