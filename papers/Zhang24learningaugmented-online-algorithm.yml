title: Learning-augmented Online Algorithm for Two-level Ski-rental Problem
authors: Keyuan Zhang, Zhongdong Liu, Nakjung Choi, Bo Ji
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the two-level ski-rental problem, where a user
  needs to fulfill a sequence of demands for multiple items by choosing one of the
  three payment options: paying for the on-demand usage (i.e., rent), buying individual
  items (i.e., single purchase), and buying all the items (i.e., combo purchase).
  Without knowing future demands, the user aims to minimize the total cost (i.e.,
  the sum of the rental, single purchase, and combo purchase costs) by balancing the
  trade-off between the expensive upfront costs (for purchase) and the potential future
  expenses (for rent). We first design a robust online algorithm (RDTSR) that offers
  a worst-case performance guarantee. While online algorithms are robust against the
  worst-case scenarios, they are often overly cautious and thus suffer a poor average
  performance in typical scenarios. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
  typically show promising average performance in various applications but lack worst-case
  performance guarantees. To harness the benefits of both methods, we develop a learning-augmented
  algorithm (LADTSR) by integrating ML predictions into the robust online algorithm,
  which outperforms the robust online algorithm under accurate predictions while ensuring
  worst-case performance guarantees even when predictions are inaccurate. Finally,
  we conduct numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world trace data to
  corroborate the effectiveness of our approach.'
