title: Online Search With a Hint
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos
abstract: "The linear search problem, informally known as the cow path problem, is one of the fundamental problems in search\
  \ theory. In this problem, an immobile target is hidden at some unknown position on an unbounded line, and a mobile searcher,\
  \ initially positioned at some specific point of the line called the root, must traverse the line so as to locate the target.\
  \ The objective is to minimize the worst-case ratio of the distance traversed by the searcher to the distance of the target\
  \ from the root, which is known as the competitive ratio of the search. \nIn this work we study this problem in a setting\
  \ in which the searcher has a hint concerning the target. We consider three settings in regards to the nature of the hint:\
  \ i) the hint suggests the exact position of the target on the line; ii) the hint suggests the direction of the optimal\
  \ search (i.e., to the left or the right of the root); and iii) the hint is a general k-bit string that encodes some information\
  \ concerning the target. Our objective is to study the Pareto-efficiency of strategies in this model. Namely, we seek optimal,\
  \ or near-optimal tradeoffs between the searcher's performance if the hint is correct (i.e., provided by a trusted source)\
  \ and if the hint is incorrect (i.e., provided by an adversary)."
