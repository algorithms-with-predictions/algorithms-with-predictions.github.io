title: Online Nash Social Welfare Maximization with Predictions

abstract: 'We consider the problem of allocating a set of divisible goods to $N$ agents
  in an online manner, aiming to maximize the Nash social welfare, a widely studied
  objective which provides a balance between fairness and efficiency. The goods arrive
  in a sequence of $T$ periods and the value of each agent for a good is adversarially
  chosen when the good arrives. We first observe that no online algorithm can achieve
  a competitive ratio better than the trivial $O(N)$, unless it is given additional
  information about the agents'' values. Then, in line with the emerging area of"algorithms
  with predictions", we consider a setting where for each agent, the online algorithm
  is only given a prediction of her monopolist utility, i.e., her utility if all goods
  were given to her alone (corresponding to the sum of her values over the $T$ periods).
  Our main result is an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is parameterized
  by the multiplicative errors in these predictions. The algorithm achieves a competitive
  ratio of $O(\log N)$ and $O(\log T)$ if the predictions are perfectly accurate.
  Moreover, the competitive ratio degrades smoothly with the errors in the predictions,
  and is surprisingly robust: the logarithmic competitive ratio holds even if the
  predictions are very inaccurate. We complement this positive result by showing that
  our bounds are essentially tight: no online algorithm, even if provided with perfectly
  accurate predictions, can achieve a competitive ratio of $O(\log^{1-\epsilon} N)$
  or $O(\log^{1-\epsilon} T)$ for any constant $\epsilon>0$.'
