abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms have been attracting increasing interest, but have only recently been considered in
  the setting of explorable uncertainty where precise values of uncertain input elements can be obtained by a query and the
  goal is to minimize the number of queries needed to solve a problem. We study learning-augmented algorithms for sorting
  and hypergraph orientation under uncertainty, assuming access to untrusted predictions for the uncertain values. Our algorithms
  provide improved performance guarantees for accurate predictions while maintaining worst-case guarantees that are best possible
  without predictions. For sorting, our algorithm uses the optimal number of queries for accurate predictions and at most
  twice the optimal number for arbitrarily wrong predictions. For hypergraph orientation, for any γ≥2, we give an algorithm
  that uses at most 1+1/γ times the optimal number of queries for accurate predictions and at most γ times the optimal number
  for arbitrarily wrong predictions. These tradeoffs are the best possible. We also consider different error metrics and show
  that the performance of our algorithms degrades smoothly with the prediction error in all the cases where this is possible.
