abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a unifying framework that generalizes both linear programming and quadratically-constrained
  quadratic programming, while also yielding efficient solvers, both in theory and in practice. However, there exist known
  impossibility results for approximating the optimal solution when constraints for covering SDPs arrive in an online fashion.
  In this paper, we study online covering linear and semidefinite programs in which the algorithm is augmented with advice
  from a possibly erroneous predictor. We show that if the predictor is accurate, we can efficiently bypass these impossibility
  results and achieve a constant-factor approximation to the optimal solution, i.e., consistency. On the other hand, if the
  predictor is inaccurate, under some technical conditions, we achieve results that match both the classical optimal upper
  bounds and the tight lower bounds up to constant factors, i.e., robustness. More broadly, we introduce a framework that
  extends both (1) the online set cover problem augmented with machine-learning predictors, studied by Bamas, Maggiori, and
  Svensson (NeurIPS 2020), and (2) the online covering SDP problem, initiated by Elad, Kale, and Naor (ICALP 2016). Specifically,
  we obtain general online learning-augmented algorithms for covering linear programs with fractional advice and constraints,
  and initiate the study of learning-augmented algorithms for covering SDP problems. Our techniques are based on the primal-dual
  framework of Buchbinder and Naor (Mathematics of Operations Research, 34, 2009) and can be further adjusted to handle constraints
  where the variables lie in a bounded region, i.e., box constraints.
