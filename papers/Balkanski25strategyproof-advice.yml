title: Strategyproof Learning with Advice
authors: Eric Balkanski, Cherlin Zhu
abstract: An important challenge in robust machine learning is when training data is provided by strategic sources who may
  intentionally report erroneous data for their own benefit. A line of work at the intersection of machine learning and mechanism
  design aims to deter strategic agents from reporting erroneous training data by designing learning algorithms that are strategyproof.
  Strategyproofness is a strong and desirable property, but it comes at a cost in the approximation ratio of even simple risk
  minimization problems. In this paper, we study strategyproof regression and classification problems in a model with advice.
  This model is part of a recent line on mechanism design with advice where the goal is to achieve both an improved approximation
  ratio when the advice is correct (consistency) and a bounded approximation ratio when the advice is incorrect (robustness).
  We provide the first non-trivial consistency-robustness tradeoffs for strategyproof regression and classification, which
  hold for simple yet interesting classes of functions. For classes of constant functions, we give a deterministic and strategyproof
  mechanism that is, for any $\gamma \in (0, 2]$, $1+\gamma$ consistent and $1 + 4/\gamma$ robust and provide a lower bound
  that shows that this tradeoff is optimal. We extend this mechanism and its guarantees to homogeneous linear regression over
  $\mathbb{R}$. In the binary classification problem of selecting from three or more labelings, we present strong impossibility
  results for both deterministic and randomized mechanism. Finally, we provide deterministic and randomized mechanisms for
  selecting from two labelings.
