title: Online Covering with Multiple Experts
authors: Eniko Kevi, Kim Thang Nguyen
abstract: Designing online algorithms with machine learning predictions is a recent technique beyond the worst-case paradigm
  for various practically relevant online problems (scheduling, caching, clustering, ski rental, etc.). While most previous
  learning-augmented algorithm approaches focus on integrating the predictions of a single oracle, we study the design of
  online algorithms with \emph{multiple} experts. To go beyond the popular benchmark of a static best expert in hindsight,
  we propose a new \emph{dynamic} benchmark (linear combinations of predictions that change over time). We present a competitive
  algorithm in the new dynamic benchmark with a performance guarantee of $O(\log K)$, where $K$ is the number of experts,
  for $0-1$ online optimization problems. Furthermore, our multiple-expert approach provides a new perspective on how to combine
  in an online manner several online algorithms - a long-standing central subject in the online algorithm research community.
