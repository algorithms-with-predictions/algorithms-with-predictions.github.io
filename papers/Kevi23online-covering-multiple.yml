title: Online Covering with Multiple Experts
authors: Kevi, Nguyen
abstract: Designing online algorithms with machine learning predictions is a recent
  technique beyond the worst-case paradigm for various practically relevant online
  problems (scheduling, caching, clustering, ski rental, etc.). While most previous
  learning-augmented algorithm approaches focus on integrating the predictions of
  a single oracle, we study the design of online algorithms with \emph{multiple} experts.
  To go beyond the popular benchmark of a static best expert in hindsight, we propose
  a new \emph{dynamic} benchmark (linear combinations of predictions that change over
  time). We present a competitive algorithm in the new dynamic benchmark with a performance
  guarantee of $O(\log K)$, where $K$ is the number of experts, for $0-1$ online optimization
  problems. Furthermore, our multiple-expert approach provides a new perspective on
  how to combine in an online manner several online algorithms - a long-standing central
  subject in the online algorithm research community.
