title: 'Learning-Augmented Online Caching: New Upper Bounds'
authors: Daniel Skachkov, Denis Ponomaryov, Yuri Dorn, Alexander Demin
abstract: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario
  when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested
  page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle
  algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower
  bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination
  of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is
  optimal up to some constant.
