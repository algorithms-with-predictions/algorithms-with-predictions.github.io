abstract: 'We study the approximability of the MaxCut problem in the presence of predictions. Specifically, we consider two
  models: in the noisy predictions model, for each vertex we are given its correct label in $\{-1,+1\}$ with some unknown
  probability $1/2 + \epsilon$, and the other (incorrect) label otherwise. In the more-informative partial predictions model,
  for each vertex we are given its correct label with probability $\epsilon$ and no label otherwise. We assume only pairwise
  independence between vertices in both models. We show how these predictions can be used to improve on the worst-case approximation
  ratios for this problem. Specifically, we give an algorithm that achieves an $\alpha + \widetilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^4)$-approximation
  for the noisy predictions model, where $\alpha \approx 0.878$ is the MaxCut threshold. While this result also holds for
  the partial predictions model, we can also give a $\beta + \Omega(\epsilon)$-approximation, where $\beta \approx 0.858$
  is the approximation ratio for MaxBisection given by Raghavendra and Tan. This answers a question posed by Ola Svensson
  in his plenary session talk at SODA''23.'
