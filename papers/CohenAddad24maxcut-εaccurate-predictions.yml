title: Max-Cut with ε-Accurate Predictions
authors: Cohen-Addad, d'Orsi, Gupta, Lee, Panigrahi
abstract: 'We study the approximability of the MaxCut problem in the presence of predictions.
  Specifically, we consider two models: in the noisy predictions model, for each vertex
  we are given its correct label in $\{-1,+1\}$ with some unknown probability $1/2
  + \epsilon$, and the other (incorrect) label otherwise. In the more-informative
  partial predictions model, for each vertex we are given its correct label with probability
  $\epsilon$ and no label otherwise. We assume only pairwise independence between
  vertices in both models. We show how these predictions can be used to improve on
  the worst-case approximation ratios for this problem. Specifically, we give an algorithm
  that achieves an $\alpha + \widetilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^4)$-approximation for the
  noisy predictions model, where $\alpha \approx 0.878$ is the MaxCut threshold. While
  this result also holds for the partial predictions model, we can also give a $\beta
  + \Omega(\epsilon)$-approximation, where $\beta \approx 0.858$ is the approximation
  ratio for MaxBisection given by Raghavendra and Tan. This answers a question posed
  by Ola Svensson in his plenary session talk at SODA''23.'
