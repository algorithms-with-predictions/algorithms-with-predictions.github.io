title: Predictive Flows for Faster Ford-Fulkerson
authors: Davies, Moseley, Vassilvitskii, Wang
abstract: Recent work has shown that leveraging learned predictions can improve the
  running time of algorithms for bipartite matching and similar combinatorial problems.
  In this work, we build on this idea to improve the performance of the widely used
  Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximum flows by seeding Ford-Fulkerson with
  predicted flows. Our proposed method offers strong theoretical performance in terms
  of the quality of the prediction. We then consider image segmentation, a common
  use-case of flows in computer vision, and complement our theoretical analysis with
  strong empirical results.
