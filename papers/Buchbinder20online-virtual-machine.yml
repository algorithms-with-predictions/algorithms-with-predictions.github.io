abstract: "The cloud computing industry has grown rapidly over the last decade, and\
  \ with this growth there is a significant increase in demand for compute resources.\
  \ Demand is manifested in the form of Virtual Machine (VM) requests, which need\
  \ to be assigned to physical machines in a way that minimizes resource fragmentation\
  \ and efficiently utilizes the available machines. This problem can be modeled as\
  \ a dynamic version of the bin packing problem with the objective of minimizing\
  \ the total usage time of the bins (physical machines). Earlier works on dynamic\
  \ bin packing assumed that no knowledge is available to the scheduler and later\
  \ works studied models in which lifetime/duration of each \"item\" (VM in our context)\
  \ is available to the scheduler. This extra information was shown to improve exponentially\
  \ the achievable competitive ratio. \nMotivated by advances in Machine Learning\
  \ that provide good estimates of workload characteristics, this paper studies the\
  \ effect of having extra information regarding future (total) demand. In the cloud\
  \ context, since demand is an aggregate over many VM requests, it can be predicted\
  \ with high accuracy (e.g., using historical data). We show that the competitive\
  \ factor can be dramatically improved by using this additional information; in some\
  \ cases, we achieve constant competitiveness, or even a competitive factor that\
  \ approaches 1. Along the way, we design new offline algorithms with improved approximation\
  \ ratios for the dynamic bin-packing problem."
