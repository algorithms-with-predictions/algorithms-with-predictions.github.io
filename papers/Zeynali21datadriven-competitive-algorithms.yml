abstract: The design of online algorithms has tended to focus on algorithms with worst-case guarantees, e.g., bounds on the
  competitive ratio. However, it is well-known that such algorithms are often overly pessimistic, performing sub-optimally
  on non-worst-case inputs. In this paper, we develop an approach for data-driven design of online algorithms that maintain
  near-optimal worst-case guarantees while also performing learning in order to perform well for typical inputs. Our approach
  is to identify policy classes that admit global worst-case guarantees, and then perform learning using historical data within
  the policy classes. We demonstrate the approach in the context of two classical problems, online knapsack and online set
  cover, proving competitive bounds for rich policy classes in each case. Additionally, we illustrate the practical implications
  via a case study on electric vehicle charging.
