title: A model for learned bloom filters and optimizing by sandwiching
authors: Michael Mitzenmacher
abstract: 'Recent work has suggested enhancing Bloom filters by using a pre-filter,
  based on applying machine learning to determine a function that models the data
  set the Bloom filter is meant to represent. Here we model such learned Bloom filters,
  with the following outcomes: (1) we clarify what guarantees can and cannot be associated
  with such a structure; (2) we show how to estimate what size the learning function
  must obtain in order to obtain improved performance; (3) we provide a simple method,
  sandwiching, for optimizing learned Bloom filters; and (4) we propose a design and
  analysis approach for a learned Bloomier filter, based on our modeling approach.'
