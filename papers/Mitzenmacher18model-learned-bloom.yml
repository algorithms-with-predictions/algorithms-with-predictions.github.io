title: A model for learned bloom filters and optimizing by sandwiching
authors: Michael Mitzenmacher
abstract: 'Recent work has suggested enhancing Bloom filters by using a pre-filter, based on applying machine learning to
  determine a function that models the data set the Bloom filter is meant to represent. Here we model such learned Bloom filters,
  with the following outcomes: (1) we clarify what guarantees can and cannot be associated with such a structure; (2) we show
  how to estimate what size the learning function must obtain in order to obtain improved performance; (3) we provide a simple
  method, sandwiching, for optimizing learned Bloom filters; and (4) we propose a design and analysis approach for a learned
  Bloomier filter, based on our modeling approach.'
