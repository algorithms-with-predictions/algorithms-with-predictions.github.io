authors: Dinitz, Im, Lavastida, Moseley, Vassilvitskii
abstract: 'A recent line of research investigates how algorithms can be augmented
  with machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area
  has revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular success
  in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question of improving
  algorithm running times with predictions has largely been unexplored. We take a
  first step in this direction by combining the idea of machine-learned predictions
  with the idea of"warm-starting"primal-dual algorithms. We consider one of the most
  important primitives in combinatorial optimization: weighted bipartite matching
  and its generalization to $b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using
  learned dual variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be
  infeasible, so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals
  to nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not
  be optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.
  Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show that
  the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We validate
  our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and synthetic data. As
  a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically effective method to compute
  bipartite matchings.'
