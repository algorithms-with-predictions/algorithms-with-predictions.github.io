abstract: The augmentation of algorithms with predictions of the optimal solution, such as from a machine-learning algorithm,
  has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in facility location problems. Moving beyond the traditional
  focus on utilitarian and egalitarian objectives, we design learning-augmented facility location mechanisms on a line for
  the envy ratio objective, a fairness metric defined as the maximum ratio between the utilities of any two agents. For the
  deterministic setting, we propose a mechanism which utilizes predictions to achieve $\alpha$-consistency and $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha
  - 1}$-robustness for a selected parameter $\alpha \in [1,2]$, and prove its optimality. We also resolve open questions raised
  by Ding et al. [10], devising a randomized mechanism without predictions to improve upon the best-known approximation ratio
  from $2$ to $1.8944$. Building upon these advancements, we construct a novel randomized mechanism which incorporates predictions
  to achieve improved performance guarantees.
