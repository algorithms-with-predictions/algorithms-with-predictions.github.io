abstract: 'This paper proposes a new model for augmenting algorithms with useful predictions that go beyond worst-case bounds
  on the algorithm performance. By refining existing models, our model ensures predictions are formally learnable and instance
  robust. Learnability guarantees that predictions can be efficiently constructed from past data. Instance robustness formally
  ensures a prediction is robust to modest changes in the problem input. Further, the robustness model ensures two different
  predictions can be objectively compared, addressing a shortcoming in prior models. This paper establishes the existence
  of predictions which satisfy these properties. The paper considers online algorithms with predictions for a network flow
  allocation problem and the restricted assignment makespan minimization problem. For both problems, three key properties
  are established: existence of useful predictions that give near optimal solutions, robustness of these predictions to errors
  that smoothly degrade as the underlying problem instance changes, and we prove high quality predictions can be learned from
  a small sample of prior instances.'
