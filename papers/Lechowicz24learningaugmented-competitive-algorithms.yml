abstract: We introduce and study spatiotemporal online allocation with deadline constraints (SOAD), a new online problem motivated
  by emerging challenges in sustainability and energy. In SOAD, an online player completes a workload by allocating and scheduling
  it on the points of a metric space (X, d) while subject to a deadline T. At each time step, a service cost function is revealed
  that represents the cost of servicing the workload at each point, and the player must irrevocably decide the current allocation
  of work to points. Whenever the player moves this allocation, they incur a movement cost defined by the distance metric
  d(⋅, ⋅) that captures, e.g., an overhead cost. SOAD formalizes the open problem of combining general metrics and deadline
  constraints in the online algorithms literature, unifying problems such as metrical task systems and online search. We propose
  a competitive algorithm for SOAD along with a matching lower bound establishing its optimality. Our main algorithm, ST-CLIP,
  is a learning-augmented algorithm that takes advantage of predictions (e.g., forecasts of relevant costs) and achieves an
  optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. We evaluate our proposed algorithms in a simulated case study of carbon-aware
  spatiotemporal workload management, an application in sustainable computing that schedules a delay-tolerant batch compute
  job on a distributed network of data centers. In these experiments, we show that ST-CLIP substantially improves on heuristic
  baseline methods.
