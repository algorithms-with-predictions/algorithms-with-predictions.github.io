title: Competitive strategies to use "warm start" algorithms with predictions
authors: Avrim Blum, Vaidehi Srinivas
abstract: We consider the problem of learning and using predictions for warm start algorithms with predictions. In this setting,
  an algorithm is given an instance of a problem, and a prediction of the solution. The runtime of the algorithm is bounded
  by the distance from the predicted solution to the true solution of the instance. Previous work has shown that when instances
  are drawn iid from some distribution, it is possible to learn an approximately optimal fixed prediction (Dinitz et al, NeurIPS
  2021), and in the adversarial online case, it is possible to compete with the best fixed prediction in hindsight (Khodak
  et al, NeurIPS 2022). In this work we give competitive guarantees against stronger benchmarks that consider a set of $k$
  predictions $\mathbf{P}$. That is, the"optimal offline cost"to solve an instance with respect to $\mathbf{P}$ is the distance
  from the true solution to the closest member of $\mathbf{P}$. This is analogous to the $k$-medians objective function. In
  the distributional setting, we show a simple strategy that incurs cost that is at most an $O(k)$ factor worse than the optimal
  offline cost. We then show a way to leverage learnable coarse information, in the form of partitions of the instance space
  into groups of"similar"instances, that allows us to potentially avoid this $O(k)$ factor. Finally, we consider an online
  version of the problem, where we compete against offline strategies that are allowed to maintain a moving set of $k$ predictions
  or"trajectories,"and are charged for how much the predictions move. We give an algorithm that does at most $O(k^4 \ln^2
  k)$ times as much work as any offline strategy of $k$ trajectories. This algorithm is deterministic (robust to an adaptive
  adversary), and oblivious to the setting of $k$. Thus the guarantee holds for all $k$ simultaneously.
