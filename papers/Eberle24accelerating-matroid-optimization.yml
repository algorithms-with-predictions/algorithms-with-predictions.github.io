abstract: Querying complex models for precise information (e.g. traffic models, database
  systems, large ML models) often entails intense computations and results in long
  response times. Thus, weaker models which give imprecise results quickly can be
  advantageous, provided inaccuracies can be resolved using few queries to a stronger
  model. In the fundamental problem of computing a maximum-weight basis of a matroid,
  a well-known generalization of many combinatorial optimization problems, algorithms
  have access to a clean oracle to query matroid information. We additionally equip
  algorithms with a fast but dirty oracle modelling an unknown, potentially different
  matroid. We design and analyze practical algorithms which only use few clean queries
  w.r.t. the quality of the dirty oracle, while maintaining robustness against arbitrarily
  poor dirty matroids, approaching the performance of classic algorithms for the given
  problem. Notably, we prove that our algorithms are, in many respects, best-possible.
  Further, we outline extensions to other matroid oracle types, non-free dirty oracles
  and other matroid problems.
