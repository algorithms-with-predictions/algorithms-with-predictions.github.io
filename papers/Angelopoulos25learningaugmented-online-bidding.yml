abstract: Online bidding is a classic optimization problem, with several applications in online decision-making, the design
  of interruptible systems, and the analysis of approximation algorithms. In this work, we study online bidding under learning-augmented
  settings that incorporate stochasticity, in either the prediction oracle or the algorithm itself. In the first part, we
  study bidding under distributional predictions, and find Pareto-optimal algorithms that offer the best-possible tradeoff
  between the consistency and the robustness of the algorithm. In the second part, we study the power and limitations of randomized
  bidding algorithms, by presenting upper and lower bounds on the consistency/robustness tradeoffs. Previous works focused
  predominantly on oracles that do not leverage stochastic information on the quality of the prediction, and deterministic
  algorithms.
