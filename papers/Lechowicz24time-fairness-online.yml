abstract: The online knapsack problem is a classic problem in the field of online
  algorithms. Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and
  weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total
  value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for
  this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated
  inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time
  fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing
  in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing
  algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic
  algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between
  fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization
  is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however,
  it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness
  and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which
  is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements
  in numerical experiments.
