title: Optimal Robustness-Consistency Trade-offs for Learning-Augmented Online Algorithms
authors: Alexander Wei, Fred Zhang
abstract: We study the problem of improving the performance of online algorithms by
  incorporating machine-learned predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that
  are both consistent and robust, meaning that the algorithm performs well when predictions
  are accurate and maintains worst-case guarantees. Such algorithms have been studied
  in a recent line of works due to Lykouris and Vassilvitskii (ICML '18) and Purohit
  et al (NeurIPS '18). They provide robustness-consistency trade-offs for a variety
  of online problems. However, they leave open the question of whether these trade-offs
  are tight, i.e., to what extent to such trade-offs are necessary. In this paper,
  we provide the first set of non-trivial lower bounds for competitive analysis using
  machine-learned predictions. We focus on the classic problems of ski-rental and
  non-clairvoyant scheduling and provide optimal trade-offs in various settings.
