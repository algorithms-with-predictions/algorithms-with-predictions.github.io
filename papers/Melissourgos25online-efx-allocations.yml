abstract:
  We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive
  sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good arrives,
  its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be immediately and irrevocably
  allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to ensure envy-freeness up to any
  good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated. Unfortunately, as we show, approximate
  EFX allocations are unattainable in general, even under restrictive assumptions
  on the valuation functions. To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend
  of augmenting algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction
  vector estimating the agents'true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine learning
  model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we measure their
  error using the total variation distance from the true valuations, that is, the
  percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with the true values. Focusing
  on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility results even
  on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore predictions or
  rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both the predictions and
  the true values and show strong lower bounds on the prediction accuracy that is
  required by any algorithm to compute an approximate EFX. These negative results
  persist even under identical valuations, contrary to the offline setting where exact
  EFX allocations always exist without the necessity of predictions. We then present
  an algorithm for two agents with identical valuations that uses effectively the
  predictions and the true values. The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees
  improving as the accuracy of the predictions increases.
