abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated
  to a given set of agents. Once a good arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be immediately and
  irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have
  been allocated. Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in general, even under restrictive
  assumptions on the valuation functions. To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting algorithms
  with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction vector estimating the agents'true valuations -- e.g., generated
  by a machine learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we measure their error using the total
  variation distance from the true valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with the true
  values. Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility results even on approximate EFX allocations
  for algorithms that either ignore predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both the predictions
  and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute
  an approximate EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary to the offline setting where
  exact EFX allocations always exist without the necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with
  identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values. The algorithm approximates EFX, with its
  guarantees improving as the accuracy of the predictions increases.
