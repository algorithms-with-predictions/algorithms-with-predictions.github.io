title: Online Algorithms with Randomly Infused Advice
authors: Yuval Emek, Yuval Gil, Maciej Pacut, Stefan Schmid
abstract: 'We introduce a novel method for the rigorous quantitative evaluation of online algorithms that relaxes the"radical
  worst-case"perspective of classic competitive analysis. In contrast to prior work, our method, referred to as randomly infused
  advice (RIA), does not make any probabilistic assumptions about the input sequence and does not rely on the development
  of designated online algorithms. Rather, it can be applied to existing online randomized algorithms, introducing a means
  to evaluate their performance in scenarios that lie outside the radical worst-case regime. More concretely, an online algorithm
  ALG with RIA benefits from pieces of advice generated by an omniscient but not entirely reliable oracle. The crux of the
  new method is that the advice is provided to ALG by writing it into the buffer B from which ALG normally reads its random
  bits, hence allowing us to augment it through a very simple and non-intrusive interface. The (un)reliability of the oracle
  is captured via a parameter 0 {\le} {\alpha} {\le} 1 that determines the probability (per round) that the advice is successfully
  infused by the oracle; if the advice is not infused, which occurs with probability 1 - {\alpha}, then the buffer B contains
  fresh random bits (as in the classic online setting). The applicability of the new RIA method is demonstrated by applying
  it to three extensively studied online problems: paging, uniform metrical task systems, and online set cover. For these
  problems, we establish new upper bounds on the competitive ratio of classic online algorithms that improve as the infusion
  parameter {\alpha} increases. These are complemented with (often tight) lower bounds on the competitive ratio of online
  algorithms with RIA for the three problems.'
