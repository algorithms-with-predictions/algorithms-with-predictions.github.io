abstract: We introduce a novel measure for quantifying the error in input predictions.
  The error is based on a minimum-cost hyperedge cover in a suitably defined hypergraph
  and provides a general template which we apply to online graph problems. The measure
  captures errors due to absent predicted requests as well as unpredicted actual requests;
  hence, predicted and actual inputs can be of arbitrary size. We achieve refined
  performance guarantees for previously studied network design problems in the online-list
  model, such as Steiner tree and facility location. Further, we initiate the study
  of learning-augmented algorithms for online routing problems, such as the online
  traveling salesperson problem and the online dial-a-ride problem, where (transportation)
  requests arrive over time (online-time model). We provide a general algorithmic
  framework and we give error-dependent performance bounds that improve upon known
  worst-case barriers, when given accurate predictions, at the cost of slightly increased
  worst-case bounds when given predictions of arbitrary quality.
