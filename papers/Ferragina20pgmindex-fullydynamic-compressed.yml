title: 'The PGM-index: a fully-dynamic compressed learned index with provable worst-case bounds'
authors: Paolo Ferragina, Giorgio Vinciguerra
abstract: We present the first learned index that supports predecessor, range queries and updates within provably efficient
  time and space bounds in the worst case. In the (static) context of just predecessor and range queries these bounds turn
  out to be optimal. We call this learned index the Piecewise Geometric Model index (PGM-index). Its flexible design allows
  us to introduce three variants which are novel in the context of learned data structures. The first variant of the PGM-index
  is able to adapt itself to the distribution of the query operations, thus resulting in the first known distribution-aware
  learned index to date. The second variant exploits the repetitiveness possibly present at the level of the learned models
  that compose the PGM-index to further compress its succinct space footprint. The third one is a multicriteria variant of
  the PGM-index that efficiently auto-tunes itself in a few seconds over hundreds of millions of keys to satisfy space-time
  constraints which evolve over time across users, devices and applications. These theoretical achievements are supported
  by a large set of experimental results on known datasets which show that the fully-dynamic PGM-index improves the space
  occupancy of existing traditional and learned indexes by up to three orders of magnitude, while still achieving their same
  or even better query and update time efficiency. As an example, in the static setting of predecessor and range queries,
  the PGM-index matches the query performance of a cache-optimised static B+-tree within two orders of magnitude (83×) less
  space; whereas in the fully-dynamic setting, where insertions and deletions are allowed, the PGM-index improves the query
  and update time performance of a B+-tree by up to 71% within three orders of magnitude (1140×) less space.
