title: Learning-Augmented Streaming Algorithms for Correlation Clustering
authors: Yinhao Dong, Shan Jiang, Shi Li, Pan Peng
abstract: We study streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering. Given a graph
  as an arbitrary-order stream of edges, with each edge labeled as positive or negative,
  the goal is to partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, such that the number
  of disagreements is minimized. In this paper, we give the first learning-augmented
  streaming algorithms for the problem on both complete and general graphs, improving
  the best-known space-approximation tradeoffs. Based on the works of Cambus et al.
  (SODA'24) and Ahn et al. (ICML'15), our algorithms use the predictions of pairwise
  distances between vertices provided by a predictor. For complete graphs, our algorithm
  achieves a better-than-$3$ approximation under good prediction quality, while using
  $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space. For general graphs, our algorithm achieves an $O(\log
  |E^-|)$ approximation under good prediction quality using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space,
  improving the best-known non-learning algorithm in terms of space efficiency. Experimental
  results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
  proposed algorithms over their non-learning counterparts.
