title: Learning-Augmented Streaming Algorithms for Correlation Clustering
authors: Yinhao Dong, Shan Jiang, Shi Li, Pan Peng
abstract: We study streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering. Given a graph as an arbitrary-order stream of edges, with
  each edge labeled as positive or negative, the goal is to partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, such that the number
  of disagreements is minimized. In this paper, we give the first learning-augmented streaming algorithms for the problem
  on both complete and general graphs, improving the best-known space-approximation tradeoffs. Based on the works of Cambus
  et al. (SODA'24) and Ahn et al. (ICML'15), our algorithms use the predictions of pairwise distances between vertices provided
  by a predictor. For complete graphs, our algorithm achieves a better-than-$3$ approximation under good prediction quality,
  while using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space. For general graphs, our algorithm achieves an $O(\log |E^-|)$ approximation under
  good prediction quality using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space, improving the best-known non-learning algorithm in terms of space
  efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms
  over their non-learning counterparts.
