title: Smoothed Online Optimization with Unreliable Predictions
authors: Daan Rutten, Nicolas Christianson, Debankur Mukherjee, Adam Wierman
abstract: 'We examine the problem of smoothed online optimization, where a decision maker must sequentially choose points
  in a normed vector space to minimize the sum of per-round, non-convex hitting costs and the costs of switching decisions
  between rounds. The decision maker has access to a black-box oracle, such as a machine learning model, that provides untrusted
  and potentially inaccurate predictions of the optimal decision in each round. The goal of the decision maker is to exploit
  the predictions if they are accurate, while guaranteeing performance that is not much worse than the hindsight optimal sequence
  of decisions, even when predictions are inaccurate. We impose the standard assumption that hitting costs are globally α-polyhedral.
  We propose a novel algorithm, Adaptive Online Switching (AOS), and prove that, for a large set of feasible δ > 0, it is
  (1+δ)-competitive if predictions are perfect, while also maintaining a uniformly bounded competitive ratio of 2~O (1/(α
  δ)) even when predictions are adversarial. Further, we prove that this trade-off is necessary and nearly optimal in the
  sense that any deterministic algorithm which is (1+δ)-competitive if predictions are perfect must be at least 2~Ω (1/(α
  δ)) -competitive when predictions are inaccurate. In fact, we observe a unique threshold-type behavior in this trade-off:
  if δ is not in the set of feasible options, then no algorithm is simultaneously (1 + δ)-competitive if predictions are perfect
  and ζ-competitive when predictions are inaccurate for any ζ < ∞. Furthermore, we discuss that memory is crucial in AOS by
  proving that any algorithm that does not use memory cannot benefit from predictions. We complement our theoretical results
  by a numerical study on a microgrid application.'
