title: Robustification of Online Graph Exploration Methods
authors: Eberle, Lindermayr, Megow, Nölke, Schlöter
abstract: Exploring unknown environments is a fundamental task in many domains, e.g.,
  robot navigation, network security, and internet search. We initiate the study of
  a learning-augmented variant of the classical, notoriously hard online graph exploration
  problem by adding access to machine-learned predictions. We propose an algorithm
  that naturally integrates predictions into the well-known Nearest Neighbor (NN)
  algorithm and significantly outperforms any known online algorithm if the prediction
  is of high accuracy while maintaining good guarantees when the prediction is of
  poor quality. We provide theoretical worst-case bounds that gracefully degrade with
  the prediction error, and we complement them by computational experiments that confirm
  our results. Further, we extend our concept to a general framework to robustify
  algorithms. By interpolating carefully between a given algorithm and NN, we prove
  new performance bounds that leverage the individual good performance on particular
  inputs while establishing robustness to arbitrary inputs.
