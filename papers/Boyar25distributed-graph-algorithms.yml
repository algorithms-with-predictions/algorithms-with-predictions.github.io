title: Distributed Graph Algorithms with Predictions
authors: J. Boyar, Faith Ellen, Kim S. Larsen
abstract: We initiate the study of deterministic distributed graph algorithms with predictions in synchronous message passing
  systems. The process at each node in the graph is given a prediction, which is some extra information about the problem
  instance that may be incorrect. The processes may use the predictions to help them solve the problem. The overall goal is
  to develop algorithms that both work faster when predictions are good and do not work much worse than algorithms without
  predictions when predictions are bad. Concepts from the more general area of algorithms with predictions, such as error
  measures, consistency, robustness, and smoothness, are adapted to distributed graph algorithms with predictions. We consider
  algorithms with predictions for four distributed graph problems, Maximal Independent Set, Maximal Matching, $(\Delta+1)$-Vertex
  Coloring, and $(2\Delta-1)$-Edge Coloring, where $\Delta$ denotes the degree of the graph. For each, we define an appropriate
  error measure. We present generic templates that can be used to design deterministic distributed graph algorithms with predictions
  from existing algorithms without predictions. Using these templates, we develop algorithms with predictions for Maximal
  Independent Set. Alternative error measures for the Maximal Independent Set problem are also considered. We obtain algorithms
  with predictions for general graphs and for rooted trees and analyze them using two of these error measures.
