abstract: We present Bayesian Binary Search (BBS), a novel framework that bridges statistical learning theory/probabilistic
  machine learning and binary search. BBS utilizes probabilistic methods to learn the underlying probability density of the
  search space. This learned distribution then informs a modified bisection strategy, where the split point is determined
  by probability density rather than the conventional midpoint. This learning process for search space density estimation
  can be achieved through various supervised probabilistic machine learning techniques (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression,
  Bayesian Neural Networks, and Quantile Regression) or unsupervised statistical learning algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Mixture
  Models, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)). Our results demonstrate substantial efficiency
  improvements using BBS on both synthetic data with diverse distributions and in a real-world scenario involving Bitcoin
  Lightning Network channel balance probing (3–6% efficiency gain), where BBS is currently in production.
