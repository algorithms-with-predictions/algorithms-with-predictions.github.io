title: Optimal Algorithms for Ski Rental with Soft Machine-Learned Predictions
authors: Rohan Kodialam
abstract: We consider a variant of the classic Ski Rental online algorithm with applications to machine learning. In our variant,
  we allow the skier access to a black-box machine-learning algorithm that provides an estimate of the probability that there
  will be at most a threshold number of ski-days. We derive a class of optimal randomized algorithms to determine the strategy
  that minimizes the worst-case expected competitive ratio for the skier given a prediction from the machine learning algorithm,and
  analyze the performance and robustness of these algorithms.
