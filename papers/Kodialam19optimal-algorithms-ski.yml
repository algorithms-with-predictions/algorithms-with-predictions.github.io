title: Optimal Algorithms for Ski Rental with Soft Machine-Learned Predictions
authors: Rohan Kodialam
abstract: We consider a variant of the classic Ski Rental online algorithm with applications
  to machine learning. In our variant, we allow the skier access to a black-box machine-learning
  algorithm that provides an estimate of the probability that there will be at most
  a threshold number of ski-days. We derive a class of optimal randomized algorithms
  to determine the strategy that minimizes the worst-case expected competitive ratio
  for the skier given a prediction from the machine learning algorithm,and analyze
  the performance and robustness of these algorithms.
