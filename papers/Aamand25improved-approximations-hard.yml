title: Improved Approximations for Hard Graph Problems using Predictions
authors: Anders Aamand, Justin Y. Chen, Siddharth Gollapudi, Sandeep Silwal, Hao Wu
abstract: We design improved approximation algorithms for NP-hard graph problems by incorporating predictions (e.g., learned
  from past data). Our prediction model builds upon and extends the $\varepsilon$-prediction framework by Cohen-Addad, d'Orsi,
  Gupta, Lee, and Panigrahi (NeurIPS 2024). We consider an edge-based version of this model, where each edge provides two
  bits of information, corresponding to predictions about whether each of its endpoints belong to an optimal solution. Even
  with weak predictions where each bit is only $\varepsilon$-correlated with the true solution, this information allows us
  to break approximation barriers in the standard setting. We develop algorithms with improved approximation ratios for MaxCut,
  Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Maximum Independent Set problems (among others). Across these problems, our algorithms share
  a unifying theme, where we separately satisfy constraints related to high degree vertices (using predictions) and low-degree
  vertices (without using predictions) and carefully combine the answers.
