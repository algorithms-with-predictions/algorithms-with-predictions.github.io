abstract: This paper develops learning-augmented algorithms for energy trading in
  volatile electricity markets. The basic problem is to sell (or buy) k units of energy
  for the highest revenue (lowest cost) over uncertain time-varying prices, which
  can framed as a classic online search problem in the literature of competitive analysis.
  State-of-the-art algorithms assume no knowledge about future market prices when
  they make trading decisions in each time slot, and aim for guaranteeing the performance
  for the worst-case price sequence. In practice, however, predictions about future
  prices become commonly available by leveraging machine learning. This paper aims
  to incorporate machine-learned predictions to design competitive algorithms for
  online search problems. An important property of our algorithms is that they achieve
  performances competitive with the offline algorithm in hindsight when the predictions
  are accurate (i.e., consistency) and also provide worst-case guarantees when the
  predictions are arbitrarily wrong (i.e., robustness). The proposed algorithms achieve
  the Pareto-optimal trade-off between consistency and robustness, where no other
  algorithms for online search can improve on the consistency for a given robustness.
  Further, we extend the basic online search problem to a more general inventory management
  setting that can capture storage-assisted energy trading in electricity markets.
  In empirical evaluations using traces from real-world applications, our learning-augmented
  algorithms improve the average empirical performance compared to benchmark algorithms,
  while also providing improved worst-case performance.
