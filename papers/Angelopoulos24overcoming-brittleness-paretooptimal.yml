abstract: The study of online algorithms with machine-learned predictions has gained considerable prominence in recent years.
  One of the common objectives in the design and analysis of such algorithms is to attain (Pareto) optimal tradeoffs between
  the consistency of the algorithm, i.e., its performance assuming perfect predictions, and its robustness, i.e., the performance
  of the algorithm under adversarial predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that this optimization criterion can be extremely
  brittle, in that the performance of Pareto-optimal algorithms may degrade dramatically even in the presence of imperceptive
  prediction error. To remedy this drawback, we propose a new framework in which the smoothness in the performance of the
  algorithm is enforced by means of a user-specified profile. This allows us to regulate the performance of the algorithm
  as a function of the prediction error, while simultaneously maintaining the analytical notion of consistency/robustness
  tradeoffs, adapted to the profile setting. We apply this new approach to a well-studied online problem, namely the one-way
  trading problem. For this problem, we further address another limitation of the state-of-the-art Pareto-optimal algorithms,
  namely the fact that they are tailored to worst-case, and extremely pessimistic inputs. We propose a new Pareto-optimal
  algorithm that leverages any deviation from the worst-case input to its benefit, and introduce a new metric that allows
  us to compare any two Pareto-optimal algorithms via a dominance relation.
