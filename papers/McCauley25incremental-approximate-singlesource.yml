abstract: The algorithms-with-predictions framework has been used extensively to develop
  online algorithms with improved beyond-worst-case competitive ratios. Recently,
  there is growing interest in leveraging predictions for designing data structures
  with improved beyond-worst-case running times. In this paper, we study the fundamental
  data structure problem of maintaining approximate shortest paths in incremental
  graphs in the algorithms-with-predictions model. Given a sequence $\sigma$ of edges
  that are inserted one at a time, the goal is to maintain approximate shortest paths
  from the source to each vertex in the graph at each time step. Before any edges
  arrive, the data structure is given a prediction of the online edge sequence $\hat{\sigma}$
  which is used to ``warm start'' its state. As our main result, we design a learned
  algorithm that maintains $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest paths,
  which runs in $\tilde{O}(m \eta \log W/\epsilon)$ time, where $W$ is the weight
  of the heaviest edge and $\eta$ is the prediction error. We show these techniques
  immediately extend to the all-pairs shortest-path setting as well. Our algorithms
  are consistent (performing nearly as fast as the offline algorithm) when predictions
  are nearly perfect, have a smooth degradation in performance with respect to the
  prediction error and, in the worst case, match the best offline algorithm up to
  logarithmic factors. As a building block, we study the offline incremental approximate
  single-source shortest-paths problem. In this problem, the edge sequence $\sigma$
  is known a priori and the goal is to efficiently return the length of the shortest
  paths in the intermediate graph $G_t$ consisting of the first $t$ edges, for all
  $t$. Note that the offline incremental problem is defined in the worst-case setting
  (without predictions) and is of independent interest.
