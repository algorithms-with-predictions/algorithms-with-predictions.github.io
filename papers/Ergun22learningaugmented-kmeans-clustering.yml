abstract: $k$-means clustering is a well-studied problem due to its wide applicability. Unfortunately, there exist strong
  theoretical limits on the performance of any algorithm for the $k$-means problem on worst-case inputs. To overcome this
  barrier, we consider a scenario where"advice"is provided to help perform clustering. Specifically, we consider the $k$-means
  problem augmented with a predictor that, given any point, returns its cluster label in an approximately optimal clustering
  up to some, possibly adversarial, error. We present an algorithm whose performance improves along with the accuracy of the
  predictor, even though na\"{i}vely following the accurate predictor can still lead to a high clustering cost. Thus if the
  predictor is sufficiently accurate, we can retrieve a close to optimal clustering with nearly optimal runtime, breaking
  known computational barriers for algorithms that do not have access to such advice. We evaluate our algorithms on real datasets
  and show significant improvements in the quality of clustering.
