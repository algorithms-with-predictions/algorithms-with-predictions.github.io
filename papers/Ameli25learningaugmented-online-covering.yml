title: Learning-Augmented Online Covering Problems
authors: Afrouz Jabal Ameli, Laura Sanità, Moritz Venzin
abstract: We give a very general and simple framework to incorporate predictions on requests for online covering problems
  in a rigorous and black-box manner. Our framework turns any online algorithm with competitive ratio $\rho(k, \cdot)$ depending
  on $k$, the number of arriving requests, into an algorithm with competitive ratio of $\rho(\eta, \cdot)$, where $\eta$ is
  the prediction error. With accurate enough prediction, the resulting competitive ratio breaks through the corresponding
  worst-case online lower bounds, and smoothly degrades as the prediction error grows. This framework directly applies to
  a wide range of well-studied online covering problems such as facility location, Steiner problems, set cover, parking permit,
  etc., and yields improved and novel bounds.
