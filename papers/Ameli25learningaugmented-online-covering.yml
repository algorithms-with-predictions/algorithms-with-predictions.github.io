title: Learning-Augmented Online Covering Problems
authors: Afrouz Jabal Ameli, Laura Sanità, Moritz Venzin
abstract: We give a very general and simple framework to incorporate predictions on
  requests for online covering problems in a rigorous and black-box manner. Our framework
  turns any online algorithm with competitive ratio $\rho(k, \cdot)$ depending on
  $k$, the number of arriving requests, into an algorithm with competitive ratio of
  $\rho(\eta, \cdot)$, where $\eta$ is the prediction error. With accurate enough
  prediction, the resulting competitive ratio breaks through the corresponding worst-case
  online lower bounds, and smoothly degrades as the prediction error grows. This framework
  directly applies to a wide range of well-studied online covering problems such as
  facility location, Steiner problems, set cover, parking permit, etc., and yields
  improved and novel bounds.
