title: Uniform Machine Scheduling with Predictions
authors: Tianming Zhao, Wei Li, Albert Y. Zomaya
abstract: The revival in learning theory has provided us with improved capabilities
  for accurate predictions. This work contributes to an emerging research agenda of
  online scheduling with predictions by studying the makespan minimization in uniformly
  related machine non-clairvoyant scheduling with job size predictions. Our task is
  to design online algorithms that effectively use predictions and have performance
  guarantees with varying prediction quality. We first propose a simple algorithm-independent
  prediction error measurement to quantify prediction quality. To effectively use
  the predicted job sizes, we design an offline improved 2-relaxed decision procedure
  approximating the optimal schedule. With this decision procedure, we propose an
  online O(min{log eta, log m})-competitive algorithm that assumes a known prediction
  error. Finally, we extend this algorithm to construct a robust O(min{log eta, log
  m})-competitive algorithm that does not assume a known error. Both algorithms require
  only moderate predictions to improve the well-known Omega(log m) lower bound, showing
  the potential of using predictions in managing uncertainty.
