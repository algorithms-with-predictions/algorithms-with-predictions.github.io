  Ski Rental

abstract: 'The learning-augmented multi-option ski rental problem generalizes the
  classical ski rental problem in two ways: the algorithm is provided with a prediction
  on the number of days we can ski, and the ski rental options now come with a variety
  of rental periods and prices to choose from, unlike the classical two-option setting.
  Subsequent to the initial study of the multi-option ski rental problem (without
  learning augmentation) due to Zhang, Poon, and Xu, significant progress has been
  made for this problem recently in particular. The problem is very well understood
  when we relinquish one of the two generalizations -- for the learning-augmented
  classical ski rental problem, algorithms giving best-possible trade-off between
  consistency and robustness exist; for the multi-option ski rental problem without
  learning augmentation, deterministic/randomized algorithms giving the best-possible
  competitiveness have been found. However, in presence of both generalizations, there
  remained a huge gap between the algorithmic and impossibility results. In fact,
  for randomized algorithms, we did not have any nontrivial lower bounds on the consistency-robustness
  trade-off before. This paper bridges this gap for both deterministic and randomized
  algorithms. For deterministic algorithms, we present a best-possible algorithm that
  completely matches the known lower bound. For randomized algorithms, we show the
  first nontrivial lower bound on the consistency-robustness trade-off, and also present
  an improved randomized algorithm. Our algorithm matches our lower bound on robustness
  within a factor of e/2 when the consistency is at most 1.086.'
