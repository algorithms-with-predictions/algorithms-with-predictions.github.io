abstract: The introduction of trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as secure
  enclaves provided by the Intel SGX technology has enabled secure and privacy-preserving
  computation on the cloud. The stringent resource limitations, such as memory constraints,
  required by some TEEs necessitates the development of computational approaches with
  reduced memory usage, such as sketching. One example is the SkSES method for GWAS
  on a cohort of case and control samples from multiple institutions, which identifies
  the most significant SNPs in a privacy-preserving manner without disclosing sensitive
  genotype information to other institutions or the cloud service provider. Here we
  show how to improve the performance of SkSES on large datasets by augmenting it
  with a learning-augmented approach. Specifically, we show how individual institutions
  can perform smaller scale GWAS on their own datasets and identify two sets of variants
  according to certain criteria, which are then used to guide the sketching process
  to more accurately identify significant variants over the collective dataset. The
  new method achieves up to 40% accuracy gain compared to the original SkSES method
  under the same memory constraints on datasets we tested on. The code is available
