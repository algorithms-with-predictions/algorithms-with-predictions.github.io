title: Fast and Simple Densest Subgraph with Predictions
authors: Bui, Vu
abstract: We study the densest subgraph problem and its variants through the lens
  of learning-augmented algorithms. For this problem, the greedy algorithm by Charikar
  (APPROX 2000) provides a linear-time $ 1/2 $-approximation, while computing the
  exact solution typically requires solving a linear program or performing maximum
  flow computations.We show that given a partial solution, i.e., one produced by a
  machine learning classifier that captures at least a $ (1 - \epsilon) $-fraction
  of nodes in the optimal subgraph, it is possible to design an extremely simple linear-time
  algorithm that achieves a provable $ (1 - \epsilon) $-approximation. Our approach
  also naturally extends to the directed densest subgraph problem and several NP-hard
  variants.An experiment on the Twitch Ego Nets dataset shows that our learning-augmented
  algorithm outperforms Charikar's greedy algorithm and a baseline that directly returns
  the predicted densest subgraph without additional algorithmic processing.
