abstract: We design online algorithms for fair allocation of public goods to a set of N agents over a sequence of T rounds
  and focus on improving their performance using predictions. In the basic model, a public good arrives in each round, and
  every agent reveals their value for it upon arrival. The algorithm must irrevocably decide the investment in this good without
  exceeding a total budget of B across all rounds. The algorithm can utilize (potentially noisy) predictions of each agent’s
  total value for all remaining goods. The algorithm's performance is measured using a proportional fairness objective, which
  informally demands that every group of agents be rewarded proportional to its size and the cohesiveness of its preferences.
  We show that no algorithm can achieve better than Θ(T/B) proportional fairness without predictions. With reasonably accurate
  predictions, the situation improves significantly, and Θ(log(T/B)) proportional fairness is achieved. We also extend our
  results to a general setting wherein a batch of L public goods arrive in each round and O(log(min(N,L)T/B)) proportional
  fairness is achieved. Our exact bounds are parameterized as a function of the prediction error, with performance degrading
  gracefully with increasing errors.
