abstract: 'We study online routing problems with predictions, inspired by recent exciting
  results emerged from the area of learning-augmented algorithms. A learning-augmented
  online algorithm, which incorporates predictions into a black-box manner to outperform
  existing algorithms if the predictions are accurate while otherwise maintaining
  theoretical guarantees, is a popular framework for overcoming pessimistic worst-case
  competitive analysis. In this paper, we particularly investigate the classical online
  traveling salesman problem (OLTSP) and online dial-a-ride problem (OLDARP), where
  future requests are augmented with predictions. Unlike the prediction models in
  other previous studies, each actual request in the OLTSP and OLDARP is associated
  with its arrival time and position, which, as imagined, leads to a more complicated
  situation. Our main result is to study different prediction models and design algorithms
  to improve the best-known results in the different settings. History: Accepted by
