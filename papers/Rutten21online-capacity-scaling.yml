title: Online Capacity Scaling Augmented With Unreliable Machine Learning Predictions
authors: Daan Rutten, Debankur Mukherjee
abstract: Modern data centers suffer from immense power consumption. As a result,
  data center operators have heavily invested in capacity scaling solutions, which
  dynamically deactivate servers if the demand is low and activate them again when
  the workload increases. We analyze a continuous-time model for capacity scaling,
  where the goal is to minimize the weighted sum of flow-time, switching cost, and
  power consumption in an online fashion. We propose a novel algorithm, called Adaptive
  Balanced Capacity Scaling (ABCS), that has access to black-box machine learning
  predictions. ABCS aims to adapt to the predictions and is also robust against unpredictable
  surges in the workload. In particular, we prove that ABCS is $(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive
  if the predictions are accurate, and yet, it has a uniformly bounded competitive
  ratio even if the predictions are completely inaccurate. Finally, we investigate
  the performance of this algorithm on a real-world dataset and carry out extensive
  numerical experiments, which positively support the theoretical results.
