title: Discrete-Convex-Analysis-Based Framework for Warm-Starting Algorithms with
  Predictions
authors: Sakaue, Oki
abstract: 'Augmenting algorithms with learned predictions is a promising approach
  for going beyond worst-case bounds. Dinitz, Im, Lavastida, Moseley, and Vassilvitskii~(2021)
  have demonstrated that a warm start with learned dual solutions can improve the
  time complexity of the Hungarian method for weighted perfect bipartite matching.
  We extend and improve their framework in a principled manner via \textit{discrete
  convex analysis} (DCA), a discrete analog of convex analysis. We show the usefulness
  of our DCA-based framework by applying it to weighted perfect bipartite matching,
  weighted matroid intersection, and discrete energy minimization for computer vision.
  Our DCA-based framework yields time complexity bounds that depend on the $\ell_\infty$-distance
  from a predicted solution to an optimal solution, which has two advantages relative
  to the previous $\ell_1$-distance-dependent bounds: time complexity bounds are smaller,
  and learning of predictions is more sample efficient. We also discuss whether to
  learn primal or dual solutions from the DCA perspective.'
