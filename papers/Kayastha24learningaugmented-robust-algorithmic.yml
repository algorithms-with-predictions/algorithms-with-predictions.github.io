title: Learning-Augmented Robust Algorithmic Recourse
authors: Kshitij Kayastha, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Shahin Jabbari
abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides individuals who receive undesirable outcomes
  from machine learning systems with minimum-cost improvements to achieve a desirable
  outcome. However, machine learning models often get updated, so the recourse may
  not lead to the desired outcome. The robust recourse framework chooses recourses
  that are less sensitive to adversarial model changes, but this comes at a higher
  cost. To address this, we initiate the study of learning-augmented algorithmic recourse
  and evaluate the extent to which a designer equipped with a prediction of the future
  model can reduce the cost of recourse when the prediction is accurate (consistency)
  while also limiting the cost even when the prediction is inaccurate (robustness).
  We propose a novel algorithm, study the robustness-consistency trade-off, and analyze
  how prediction accuracy affects performance.
