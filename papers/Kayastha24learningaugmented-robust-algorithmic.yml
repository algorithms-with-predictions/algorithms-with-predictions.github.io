title: Learning-Augmented Robust Algorithmic Recourse
authors: Kshitij Kayastha, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Shahin Jabbari
abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides individuals who receive undesirable outcomes from machine learning systems with minimum-cost
  improvements to achieve a desirable outcome. However, machine learning models often get updated, so the recourse may not
  lead to the desired outcome. The robust recourse framework chooses recourses that are less sensitive to adversarial model
  changes, but this comes at a higher cost. To address this, we initiate the study of learning-augmented algorithmic recourse
  and evaluate the extent to which a designer equipped with a prediction of the future model can reduce the cost of recourse
  when the prediction is accurate (consistency) while also limiting the cost even when the prediction is inaccurate (robustness).
  We propose a novel algorithm, study the robustness-consistency trade-off, and analyze how prediction accuracy affects performance.
