title: Non-Clairvoyant Scheduling with Progress Bars
authors: Benomar, Cosson, Lindermayr, Schlöter
abstract: 'In non-clairvoyant scheduling, the goal is to minimize the total job completion
  time without prior knowledge of individual job processing times. This classical
  online optimization problem has recently gained attention through the framework
  of learning-augmented algorithms. We introduce a natural setting in which the scheduler
  receives continuous feedback in the form of progress bars: estimates of the fraction
  of each job completed over time. We design new algorithms for both adversarial and
  stochastic progress bars and prove strong competitive bounds. Our results in the
  adversarial case surprisingly induce improved guarantees for learning-augmented
  scheduling with job size predictions. We also introduce a general method for combining
  scheduling algorithms, yielding further insights in scheduling with predictions.
  Finally, we propose a stochastic model of progress bars as a more optimistic alternative
  to conventional worst-case models, and present an asymptotically optimal scheduling
  algorithm in this setting.'
