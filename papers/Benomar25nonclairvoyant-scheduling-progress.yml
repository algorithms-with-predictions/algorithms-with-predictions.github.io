title: Non-Clairvoyant Scheduling with Progress Bars
authors: Ziyad Benomar, Romain Cosson, Alexander Lindermayr, Jens Schlöter
abstract: 'In non-clairvoyant scheduling, the goal is to minimize the total job completion time without prior knowledge of
  individual job processing times. This classical online optimization problem has recently gained attention through the framework
  of learning-augmented algorithms. We introduce a natural setting in which the scheduler receives continuous feedback in
  the form of progress bars: estimates of the fraction of each job completed over time. We design new algorithms for both
  adversarial and stochastic progress bars and prove strong competitive bounds. Our results in the adversarial case surprisingly
  induce improved guarantees for learning-augmented scheduling with job size predictions. We also introduce a general method
  for combining scheduling algorithms, yielding further insights in scheduling with predictions. Finally, we propose a stochastic
  model of progress bars as a more optimistic alternative to conventional worst-case models, and present an asymptotically
  optimal scheduling algorithm in this setting.'
