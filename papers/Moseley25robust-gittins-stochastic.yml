title: Robust Gittins for Stochastic Scheduling

abstract: 'A common theme in stochastic optimization problems is that, theoretically,
  stochastic algorithms need to "know" relatively rich information about the underlying
  distributions. This is at odds with most applications, where distributions are rough
  predictions based on historical data. Thus, commonly, stochastic algorithms are
  making decisions using imperfect predicted distributions, while trying to optimize
  over some unknown true distributions. We consider the fundamental problem of scheduling
  stochastic jobs preemptively on a single machine to minimize expected mean completion
  time in the setting where the scheduler is only given imperfect predicted job size
  distributions. If the predicted distributions are perfect, then it is known that
  this problem can be solved optimally by the Gittins index policy. The goal of our
  work is to design a scheduling policy that is robust in the sense that it produces
  nearly optimal schedules even if there are modest discrepancies between the predicted
  distributions and the underlying real distributions. Our main contributions are:
  - We show that the standard Gittins index policy is not robust in this sense. If
  the true distributions are perturbed by even an arbitrarily small amount, then running
  the Gittins index policy using the perturbed distributions can lead to an unbounded
  increase in mean completion time. - We explain how to modify the Gittins index policy
  to make it robust, that is, to produce nearly optimal schedules, where the approximation
  depends on a new measure of error between the true and predicted distributions that
  we define. Looking forward, the approach we develop here can be applied more broadly
  to many other stochastic optimization problems to better understand the impact of
  mispredictions, and lead to the development of new algorithms that are robust against
  such mispredictions.'
