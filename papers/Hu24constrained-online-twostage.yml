abstract: We consider an online two-stage stochastic optimization with long-term constraints
  over a finite horizon of $T$ periods. At each period, we take the first-stage action,
  observe a model parameter realization and then take the second-stage action from
  a feasible set that depends both on the first-stage decision and the model parameter.
  We aim to minimize the cumulative objective value while guaranteeing that the long-term
  average second-stage decision belongs to a set. We develop online algorithms for
  the online two-stage problem from adversarial learning algorithms. Also, the regret
  bound of our algorithm can be reduced to the regret bound of embedded adversarial
  learning algorithms. Based on this framework, we obtain new results under various
  settings. When the model parameters are drawn from unknown non-stationary distributions
  and we are given machine-learned predictions of the distributions, we develop a
  new algorithm from our framework with a regret $O(W_T+\sqrt{T})$, where $W_T$ measures
  the total inaccuracy of the machine-learned predictions. We then develop another
  algorithm that works when no machine-learned predictions are given and show the
  performances.
