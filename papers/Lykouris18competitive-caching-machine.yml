title: Competitive Caching with Machine Learned Advice
authors: Thodoris Lykouris, Sergei Vassilvitskii
abstract: "Traditional online algorithms encapsulate decision making under uncertainty, and give ways to hedge against all\
  \ possible future events, while guaranteeing a nearly optimal solution, as compared to an offline optimum. On the other\
  \ hand, machine learning algorithms are in the business of extrapolating patterns found in the data to predict the future,\
  \ and usually come with strong guarantees on the expected generalization error.\n In this work, we develop a framework for\
  \ augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned predictor to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon\
  \ unconditional worst-case lower bounds when the predictor has low error. Our approach treats the predictor as a complete\
  \ black box and is not dependent on its inner workings or the exact distribution of its errors.\n \n We apply this framework\
  \ to the traditional caching problem—creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size\n k\n . We demonstrate that naively\
  \ following the oracle’s recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when the average error is quite low. Instead,\
  \ we show how to modify the Marker algorithm to take into account the predictions and prove that this combined approach\
  \ achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the predictor’s error decreases and (ii) is always capped by\n\
  \ O\n (log\n k\n ), which can be achieved without any assistance from the predictor. We complement our results with an empirical\
  \ evaluation of our algorithm on real-world datasets and show that it performs well empirically even when using simple off-the-shelf\
  \ predictions."
