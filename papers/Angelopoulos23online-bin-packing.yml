title: Online Bin Packing with Predictions
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos, Shahin Kamali, Kimia Shadkami
abstract: Bin packing is a classic optimization problem with a wide range of applications from load balancing to supply chain
  management. In this work, we study the online variant of the problem, in which a sequence of items of various sizes must
  be placed into a minimum number of bins of uniform capacity. The online algorithm is enhanced with a (potentially erroneous)
  prediction concerning the frequency of item sizes in the sequence. We design and analyze online algorithms with efficient
  tradeoffs between the consistency (i.e., the competitive ratio assuming no prediction error) and the robustness (i.e., the
  competitive ratio under adversarial error), and whose performance degrades near-optimally as a function of the prediction
  error. This is the first theoretical and experimental study of online bin packing in the realistic setting of learnable
  predictions. Previous work addressed only extreme cases with respect to the prediction error, and relied on overly powerful
  and error-free oracles.
