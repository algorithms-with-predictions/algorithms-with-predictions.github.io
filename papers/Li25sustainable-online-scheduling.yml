title: Learning for Sustainable Online Scheduling with Competitive Fairness Guarantees

abstract: In this paper, we investigate an online scheduling problem with covering
  constraints, in which a decision-maker must make sequential scheduling decisions
  with incomplete future information while satisfying long-term constraints. The decision-maker
  seeks to optimize both efficiency and fairness, yet the lack of perfect future information
  in the online setting and the conflicting nature of these objectives poses a significant
  challenge. To address this, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm, called LCF,
  for a general class of covering-constrained online scheduling problems that seeks
  to optimize efficiency while maintaining a strict fairness guarantee against any
  specified fairness-oriented baseline algorithm. Specifically, we present a first-of-its-kind
  analysis of a learning-augmented algorithm with both a cost/efficiency guarantee
  as well as a (1 + λ)-competitive fairness guarantee for any non-negative λ. To illustrate
  the real-world applicability of LCF, we present a case study focused on the efficient
  scheduling of distributed large language model (LLM) training, showcasing its ability
  to optimize operational costs while adhering to strict covering and fairness constraints.
