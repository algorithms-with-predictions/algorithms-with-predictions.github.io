title: Online Search With Best-Price and Query-Based Predictions
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos, Shahin Kamali, Dehou Zhang
abstract: "In the online (time-series) search problem, a player is presented with a sequence of prices which are revealed\
  \ in an online manner. In the standard definition of the problem, for each revealed price, the player must decide irrevocably\
  \ whether to accept or reject it, without knowledge of future prices (other than an upper and a lower bound on their extreme\
  \ values), and the objective is to minimize the competitive ratio, namely the worst case ratio between the maximum price\
  \ in the sequence and the one selected by the player. The problem formulates several applications of decision-making in\
  \ the face of uncertainty on the revealed samples.\n \n Previous work on this problem has largely assumed extreme scenarios\
  \ in which either the player has almost no information about the input, or the player is provided with some powerful, and\
  \ error-free advice. In this work, we study learning-augmented algorithms, in which there is a potentially erroneous prediction\
  \ concerning the input. Specifically, we consider two different settings: the setting in which the prediction is related\
  \ to the maximum price in the sequence, as well as well as the setting in which the prediction is obtained as a response\
  \ to a number of binary queries. For both settings, we provide tight, or near-tight upper and lower bounds on the worst-case\
  \ performance of search algorithms as a function of the prediction error. We also provide experimental results on data obtained\
  \ from stock exchange markets that confirm the theoretical analysis, and explain how our techniques can be applicable to\
  \ other learning-augmented applications."
