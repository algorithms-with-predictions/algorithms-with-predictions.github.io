title: Near-optimal bounds for online caching with machine learned advice
authors: Rohatgi
abstract: "In the model of online caching with machine learned advice, introduced\
  \ by Lykouris and Vassilvitskii, the goal is to solve the caching problem with an\
  \ online algorithm that has access to next-arrival predictions: when each input\
  \ element arrives, the algorithm is given a prediction of the next time when the\
  \ element will reappear. The traditional model for online caching suffers from an\
  \ $\\Omega(\\log k)$ competitive ratio lower bound (on a cache of size $k$). In\
  \ contrast, the augmented model admits algorithms which beat this lower bound when\
  \ the predictions have low error, and asymptotically match the lower bound when\
  \ the predictions have high error, even if the algorithms are oblivious to the prediction\
  \ error. In particular, Lykouris and Vassilvitskii showed that there is a prediction-augmented\
  \ caching algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(1+\\min(\\sqrt{\\eta/OPT}, \\\
  log k))$ when the overall $\\ell_1$ prediction error is bounded by $\\eta$, and\
  \ $OPT$ is the cost of the optimal offline algorithm. \nThe dependence on $k$ in\
  \ the competitive ratio is optimal, but the dependence on $\\eta/OPT$ may be far\
  \ from optimal. In this work, we make progress towards closing this gap. Our contributions\
  \ are twofold. First, we provide an improved algorithm with a competitive ratio\
  \ of $O(1 + \\min((\\eta/OPT)/k, 1) \\log k)$. Second, we provide a lower bound\
  \ of $\\Omega(\\log \\min((\\eta/OPT)/(k \\log k), k))$."
