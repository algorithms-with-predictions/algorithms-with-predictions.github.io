title: Randomized Strategic Facility Location with Predictions
authors: Balkanski, Gkatzelis, Shahkarami
abstract: In the strategic facility location problem, a set of agents report their
  locations in a metric space and the goal is to use these reports to open a new facility,
  minimizing an aggregate distance measure from the agents to the facility. However,
  agents are strategic and may misreport their locations to influence the facility's
  placement in their favor. The aim is to design truthful mechanisms, ensuring agents
  cannot gain by misreporting. This problem was recently revisited through the learning-augmented
  framework, aiming to move beyond worst-case analysis and design truthful mechanisms
  that are augmented with (machine-learned) predictions. The focus of this prior work
  was on mechanisms that are deterministic and augmented with a prediction regarding
  the optimal facility location. In this paper, we provide a deeper understanding
  of this problem by exploring the power of randomization as well as the impact of
  different types of predictions on the performance of truthful learning-augmented
  mechanisms. We study both the single-dimensional and the Euclidean case and provide
  upper and lower bounds regarding the achievable approximation of the optimal egalitarian
  social cost.
