title: Contract Scheduling with Distributional and Multiple Advice
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos, Marcin Bieńkowski, Christoph Durr, Bertrand Simon
abstract: Contract scheduling is a widely studied framework for designing real-time
  systems with interruptible capabilities. Previous work has showed that a prediction
  on the interruption time can help improve the performance of contract-based systems,
  however it has relied on a single prediction that is provided by a deterministic
  oracle. In this work, we introduce and study more general and realistic learning-augmented
  settings in which the prediction is in the form of a probability distribution, or
  it is given as a set of multiple possible interruption times. For both prediction
  settings, we design and analyze schedules which perform optimally if the prediction
  is accurate, while simultaneously guaranteeing the best worst-case performance if
  the prediction is adversarial. We also provide evidence that the resulting system
  is robust to prediction errors in the distributional setting. Last, we present an
  experimental evaluation that confirms the theoretical findings, and illustrates
  the performance improvements that can be attained in practice.
