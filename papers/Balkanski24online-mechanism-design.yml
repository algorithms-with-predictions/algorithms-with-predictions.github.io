abstract: Aiming to overcome some of the limitations of worst-case analysis, the recently proposed framework of "algorithms
  with predictions" allows algorithms to be augmented with a (possibly erroneous) machine-learned prediction that they can
  use as a guide. In this framework, the goal is to obtain improved guarantees when the prediction is correct, which is called
  consistency, while simultaneously guaranteeing some worst-case bounds even when the prediction is arbitrarily wrong, which
  is called robustness. The vast majority of the work on this framework has focused on a refined analysis of online algorithms
  augmented with predictions regarding the future input. A subsequent line of work has also successfully adapted this framework
  to mechanism design, where the prediction is regarding the private information of strategic agents. In this paper, we initiate
  the study of online mechanism design with predictions, which combines the challenges of online algorithms with predictions
  and mechanism design with predictions. We consider the well-studied problem of designing a revenue-maximizing auction to
  sell a single item to strategic bidders who arrive and depart over time, each with an unknown, private, value for the item.
  We study the learning-augmented version of this problem where the auction designer is given a prediction regarding the maximum
  value over all agents. Our main result is a strategyproof mechanism whose revenue guarantees are α-consistent with respect
  to the highest value and (1 - α2)/4-robust with respect to the second-highest value, for α ∈ [0, 1]. We extend our mechanism
  to also obtain expected revenue that is proportional to the prediction quality. We complement our positive results with
  impossibility results. For the original setting without predictions, we prove that the best-known competitive ratio of 1/4
  is optimal for a large family of auctions whose pricing rule can be an arbitrary function of the values observed in the
  past, but no more than the maximum seen so far. The proof relies on an LP formulation of the revenue maximization problem
  and duality. For the learning-augmented setting, we prove that the robustness-consistency trade-off achieved by our auction
  is optimal within a class of learning-augmented online auctions. A full version of this paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02879.
