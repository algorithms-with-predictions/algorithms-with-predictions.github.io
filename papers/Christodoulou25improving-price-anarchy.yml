title: Improving the Price of Anarchy via Predictions in Parallel-Link Networks
authors: George Christodoulou, Vasilis Christoforidis, Alkmini Sgouritsa, Ioannis Vlachos
abstract: 'We study non-atomic congestion games on parallel-link networks with affine cost functions. We investigate the power
  of machine-learned predictions in the design of coordination mechanisms aimed at minimizing the impact of selfishness. Our
  main results demonstrate that enhancing coordination mechanisms with a simple advice on the input rate can optimize the
  social cost whenever the advice is accurate (consistency), while only incurring minimal losses even when the predictions
  are arbitrarily inaccurate (bounded robustness). Moreover, we provide a full characterization of the consistent mechanisms
  that holds for all monotone cost functions, and show that our suggested mechanism is optimal with respect to the robustness.
  We further explore the notion of smoothness within this context: we extend our mechanism to achieve error-tolerance, i.e.
  we provide an approximation guarantee that degrades smoothly as a function of the prediction error, up to a predetermined
  threshold, while achieving a bounded robustness.'
