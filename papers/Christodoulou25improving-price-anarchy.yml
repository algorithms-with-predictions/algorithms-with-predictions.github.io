abstract: 'We study non-atomic congestion games on parallel-link networks with affine
  cost functions. We investigate the power of machine-learned predictions in the design
  of coordination mechanisms aimed at minimizing the impact of selfishness. Our main
  results demonstrate that enhancing coordination mechanisms with a simple advice
  on the input rate can optimize the social cost whenever the advice is accurate (consistency),
  while only incurring minimal losses even when the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate
  (bounded robustness). Moreover, we provide a full characterization of the consistent
  mechanisms that holds for all monotone cost functions, and show that our suggested
  mechanism is optimal with respect to the robustness. We further explore the notion
  of smoothness within this context: we extend our mechanism to achieve error-tolerance,
  i.e. we provide an approximation guarantee that degrades smoothly as a function
  of the prediction error, up to a predetermined threshold, while achieving a bounded
  robustness.'
