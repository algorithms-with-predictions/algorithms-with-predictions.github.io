abstract: In this work, we consider the $k$-Canadian Traveller Problem ($k$-CTP) under the learning-augmented framework proposed
  by Lykouris&Vassilvitskii. $k$-CTP is a generalization of the shortest path problem, and involves a traveller who knows
  the entire graph in advance and wishes to find the shortest route from a source vertex $s$ to a destination vertex $t$,
  but discovers online that some edges (up to $k$) are blocked once reaching them. A potentially imperfect predictor gives
  us the number and the locations of the blocked edges. We present a deterministic and a randomized online algorithm for the
  learning-augmented $k$-CTP that achieve a tradeoff between consistency (quality of the solution when the prediction is correct)
  and robustness (quality of the solution when there are errors in the prediction). Moreover, we prove a matching lower bound
  for the deterministic case establishing that the tradeoff between consistency and robustness is optimal, and show a lower
  bound for the randomized algorithm. Finally, we prove several deterministic and randomized lower bounds on the competitive
  ratio of $k$-CTP depending on the prediction error, and complement them, in most cases, with matching upper bounds.
