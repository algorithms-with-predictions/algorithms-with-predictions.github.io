title: Improved Learning-augmented Algorithms for k-means and k-medians Clustering
authors: Thy Dinh Nguyen, Anamay Chaturvedi, Huy L. Nguyen
abstract: We consider the problem of clustering in the learning-augmented setting, where we are given a data set in $d$-dimensional
  Euclidean space, and a label for each data point given by an oracle indicating what subsets of points should be clustered
  together. This setting captures situations where we have access to some auxiliary information about the data set relevant
  for our clustering objective, for instance the labels output by a neural network. Following prior work, we assume that there
  are at most an $\alpha \in (0,c)$ for some $c<1$ fraction of false positives and false negatives in each predicted cluster,
  in the absence of which the labels would attain the optimal clustering cost $\mathrm{OPT}$. For a dataset of size $m$, we
  propose a deterministic $k$-means algorithm that produces centers with improved bound on clustering cost compared to the
  previous randomized algorithm while preserving the $O( d m \log m)$ runtime. Furthermore, our algorithm works even when
  the predictions are not very accurate, i.e. our bound holds for $\alpha$ up to $1/2$, an improvement over $\alpha$ being
  at most $1/7$ in the previous work. For the $k$-medians problem we improve upon prior work by achieving a biquadratic improvement
  in the dependence of the approximation factor on the accuracy parameter $\alpha$ to get a cost of $(1+O(\alpha))\mathrm{OPT}$,
  while requiring essentially just $O(md \log^3 m/\alpha)$ runtime.
