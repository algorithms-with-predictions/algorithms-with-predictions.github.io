title: Online Algorithms for Weighted Paging with Predictions
authors: Zhihao Jiang, Debmalya Panigrahi, Kevin Sun
abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of the weighted paging problem with predictions. This continues the recent
  line of work in online algorithms with predictions, particularly that of Lykouris and Vassilvitski (ICML 2018) and Rohatgi
  (SODA 2020) on unweighted paging with predictions. We show that unlike unweighted paging, neither a fixed lookahead nor
  a knowledge of the next request for every page is sufficient information for an algorithm to overcome the existing lower
  bounds in weighted paging. However, a combination of the two, which we call strong per request prediction (SPRP), suffices
  to give a 2-competitive algorithm. We also explore the question of gracefully degrading algorithms with increasing prediction
  error, and give both upper and lower bounds for a set of natural measures of prediction error.
