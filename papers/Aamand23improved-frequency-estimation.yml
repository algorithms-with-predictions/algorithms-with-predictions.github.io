abstract: Estimating frequencies of elements appearing in a data stream is a key task
  in large-scale data analysis. Popular sketching approaches to this problem (e.g.,
  CountMin and CountSketch) come with worst-case guarantees that probabilistically
  bound the error of the estimated frequencies for any possible input. The work of
  Hsu et al. (2019) introduced the idea of using machine learning to tailor sketching
  algorithms to the specific data distribution they are being run on. In particular,
  their learning-augmented frequency estimation algorithm uses a learned heavy-hitter
  oracle which predicts which elements will appear many times in the stream. We give
  a novel algorithm, which in some parameter regimes, already theoretically outperforms
  the learning based algorithm of Hsu et al. without the use of any predictions. Augmenting
  our algorithm with heavy-hitter predictions further reduces the error and improves
  upon the state of the art. Empirically, our algorithms achieve superior performance
  in all experiments compared to prior approaches.
