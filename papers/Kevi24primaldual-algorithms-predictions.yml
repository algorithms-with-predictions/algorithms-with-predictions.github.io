title: Primal-Dual Algorithms with Predictions for Online Bounded Allocation and Ad-Auctions Problems
authors: Eniko Kevi, Kim Thang Nguyen
abstract: Matching problems have been widely studied in the research community, especially Ad-Auctions with many applications
  ranging from network design to advertising. Following the various advancements in machine learning, one natural question
  is whether classical algorithms can benefit from machine learning and obtain better-quality solutions. Even a small percentage
  of performance improvement in matching problems could result in significant gains for the studied use cases. For example,
  the network throughput or the revenue of Ad-Auctions can increase remarkably. This paper presents algorithms with machine
  learning predictions for the Online Bounded Allocation and the Online Ad-Auctions problems. We constructed primal-dual algorithms
  that achieve competitive performance depending on the quality of the predictions. When the predictions are accurate, the
  algorithms' performance surpasses previous performance bounds, while when the predictions are misleading, the algorithms
  maintain standard worst-case performance guarantees. We provide supporting experiments on generated data for our theoretical
  findings.
