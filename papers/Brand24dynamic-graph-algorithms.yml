title: On Dynamic Graph Algorithms with Predictions
authors: Jan van den Brand, S. Forster, Yasamin Nazari, Adam Polak
abstract: We study dynamic algorithms in the model of algorithms with predictions. We assume the algorithm is given imperfect
  predictions regarding future updates, and we ask how such predictions can be used to improve the running time. This can
  be seen as a model interpolating between classic online and offline dynamic algorithms. Our results give smooth tradeoffs
  between these two extreme settings. First, we give algorithms for incremental and decremental transitive closure and approximate
  APSP that take as an additional input a predicted sequence of updates (edge insertions, or edge deletions, respectively).
  They preprocess it in $\tilde{O}(n^{(3+\omega)/2})$ time, and then handle updates in $\tilde{O}(1)$ worst-case time and
  queries in $\tilde{O}(\eta^2)$ worst-case time. Here $\eta$ is an error measure that can be bounded by the maximum difference
  between the predicted and actual insertion (deletion) time of an edge, i.e., by the $\ell_\infty$-error of the predictions.
  The second group of results concerns fully dynamic problems with vertex updates, where the algorithm has access to a predicted
  sequence of the next $n$ updates. We show how to solve fully dynamic triangle detection, maximum matching, single-source
  reachability, and more, in $O(n^{\omega-1}+n\eta_i)$ worst-case update time. Here $\eta_i$ denotes how much earlier the
  $i$-th update occurs than predicted. Our last result is a reduction that transforms a worst-case incremental algorithm without
  predictions into a fully dynamic algorithm which is given a predicted deletion time for each element at the time of its
  insertion. As a consequence we can, e.g., maintain fully dynamic exact APSP with such predictions in $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ worst-case
  vertex insertion time and $\tilde{O}(n^2 (1+\eta_i))$ worst-case vertex deletion time (for the prediction error $\eta_i$
  defined as above).
