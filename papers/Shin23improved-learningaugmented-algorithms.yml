abstract: In this paper, we present improved learning-augmented algorithms for the multi-option ski rental problem. Learning-augmented
  algorithms take ML predictions as an added part of the input and incorporates these predictions in solving the given problem.
  Due to their unique strength that combines the power of ML predictions with rigorous performance guarantees, they have been
  extensively studied in the context of online optimization problems. Even though ski rental problems are one of the canonical
  problems in the field of online optimization, only deterministic algorithms were previously known for multi-option ski rental,
  with or without learning augmentation. We present the first randomized learning-augmented algorithm for this problem, surpassing
  previous performance guarantees given by deterministic algorithms. Our learning-augmented algorithm is based on a new, provably
  best-possible randomized competitive algorithm for the problem. Our results are further complemented by lower bounds for
  deterministic and randomized algorithms, and computational experiments evaluating our algorithms' performance improvements.
