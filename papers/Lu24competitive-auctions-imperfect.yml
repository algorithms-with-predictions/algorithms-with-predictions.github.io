abstract: 'The competitive auction was first proposed by Goldberg, Hartline, and Wright.
  In their paper [Goldberg et al, 2001], they introduce the competitive analysis framework
  of online algorithm design into the traditional revenue-maximizing auction design
  problem. While the competitive analysis framework only cares about the worst-case
  bound, a growing body of work in the online algorithm community studies the learning-augmented
  framework. In this framework, designers are allowed to leverage imperfect machine-learned
  predictions of unknown information and pursue better theoretical guarantees when
  the prediction is accurate(consistency). Meanwhile, designers also need to maintain
  a nearly-optimal worst-case ratio(robustness). In this work, we revisit the competitive
  auctions in the learning-augmented setting. We leverage the imperfect predictions
  of the private value of the bidders and design the learning-augmented mechanisms
  for several competitive auctions with different constraints, including: digital
  good auctions, limited-supply auctions, and general downward-closed permutation
  environments. We also design the learning-augmented mechanism for online auctions.
  For all these auction environments, our mechanisms enjoy 1-consistency against the
  strongest benchmark OPT. In contrast, it is impossible to achieve O(1)-competitiveness
  against OPT without predictions. At the same time, our mechanisms also maintain
  the O(1)-robustness against all benchmarks considered in the traditional competitive
  analysis, including ℱ(2), maxV, and EFO(2). Considering the possible inaccuracy
  of the predictions, we provide a reduction that transforms our learning-augmented
  mechanisms into an error-tolerant version, which enables the learning-augmented
  mechanism to ensure satisfactory revenue in scenarios where the prediction error
  is moderate. We also prove a 3 robustness ratio lower bound for mechanisms with
  perfect consistency. The lower bound is strictly greater than the optimal 2.42 competitive
  ratio of digital good auctions, showing the impossibility of maintaining the optimal
  worst-case bound with perfect consistency.'
