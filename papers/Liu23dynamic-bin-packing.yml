title: Dynamic Bin Packing with Predictions
authors: Mozhengfu Liu, Xueyan Tang
abstract: The MinUsageTime Dynamic Bin Packing (DBP) problem aims to minimize the
  accumulated bin usage time for packing a sequence of items into bins. It is often
  used to model job dispatching for optimizing the busy time of servers, where the
  items and bins match the jobs and servers respectively. It is known that the competitiveness
  of MinUsageTime DBP has tight bounds of Θ(√, log μ) and Θ(μ) in the clairvoyant
  and non-clairvoyant settings respectively, where μ is the max/min duration ratio
  of all items. In practice, the information about items' durations (i.e., job lengths)
  obtained via predictions is usually prone to errors. In this paper, we study the
  MinUsageTime DBP problem with predictions of items' durations. We find that an existing
  O(√ log μ)-competitive clairvoyant algorithm, if using predicted durations rather
  than real durations for packing, does not provide any bounded performance guarantee
  when the predictions are adversarially bad. We develop a new online algorithm with
  a competitive ratio of {O(∈2 √ log(∈2 μ)}, O(μ) (where ε is the maximum multiplicative
  error of prediction among all items), achieving O(√ log μ) consistency (competitiveness
  under perfect predictions where ∈ = 1) and O(μ) robustness (competitiveness under
  terrible predictions), both of which are asymptotically optimal.
