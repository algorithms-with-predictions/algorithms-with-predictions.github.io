title: A New Approach to Capacity Scaling Augmented With Unreliable Machine Learning
  Predictions
authors: Daan Rutten, Debankur Mukherjee
abstract: 'Modern data centers suffer from immense power consumption. As a result,
  data center operators have heavily invested in capacity-scaling solutions, which
  dynamically deactivate servers if the demand is low and activate them again when
  the workload increases. We analyze a continuous-time model for capacity scaling,
  where the goal is to minimize the weighted sum of flow time, switching cost, and
  power consumption in an online fashion. We propose a novel algorithm, called adaptive
  balanced capacity scaling (ABCS), that has access to black-box machine learning
  predictions. ABCS aims to adapt to the predictions and is also robust against unpredictable
  surges in the workload. In particular, we prove that ABCS is [Formula: see text]
  competitive if the predictions are accurate, and yet, it has a uniformly bounded
  competitive ratio even if the predictions are completely inaccurate. Finally, we
  investigate the performance of this algorithm on a real-world data set and carry
  out extensive numerical experiments, which positively support the theoretical results.
