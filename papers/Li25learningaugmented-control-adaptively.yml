title: 'Learning-Augmented Control: Adaptively Confidence Learning for Competitive MPC'
authors: Tongxin Li
abstract: We introduce Learning-Augmented Control (LAC), an approach that integrates untrusted machine learning predictions
  into the control of constrained, nonlinear dynamical systems. LAC is designed to achieve the"best-of-both-worlds"guarantees,
  i.e, near-optimal performance when predictions are accurate, and robust, safe performance when they are not. The core of
  our approach is a delayed confidence learning procedure that optimizes a confidence parameter online, adaptively balancing
  between ML and nominal predictions. We establish formal competitive ratio bounds for general nonlinear systems under standard
  MPC regularity assumptions. For the linear quadratic case, we derive a competitive ratio bound that is provably tight, thereby
  characterizing the fundamental limits of this learning-augmented approach. The effectiveness of LAC is demonstrated in numerical
  studies, where it maintains stability and outperforms standard methods under adversarial prediction errors.
