title: '''Learning-Augmented Control: Adaptively Confidence Learning for Competitive
  MPC'''
authors: Tongxin Li
abstract: We introduce Learning-Augmented Control (LAC), an approach that integrates
  untrusted machine learning predictions into the control of constrained, nonlinear
  dynamical systems. LAC is designed to achieve the"best-of-both-worlds"guarantees,
  i.e, near-optimal performance when predictions are accurate, and robust, safe performance
  when they are not. The core of our approach is a delayed confidence learning procedure
  that optimizes a confidence parameter online, adaptively balancing between ML and
  nominal predictions. We establish formal competitive ratio bounds for general nonlinear
  systems under standard MPC regularity assumptions. For the linear quadratic case,
  we derive a competitive ratio bound that is provably tight, thereby characterizing
  the fundamental limits of this learning-augmented approach. The effectiveness of
  LAC is demonstrated in numerical studies, where it maintains stability and outperforms
  standard methods under adversarial prediction errors.
