title: Non-Clairvoyant Scheduling with Predictions
authors: Sungjin Im, Ravi Kumar, Mahshid Montazer Qaem, Manish Purohit
abstract: In the single-machine non-clairvoyant scheduling problem, the goal is to minimize the total completion time of jobs
  whose processing times are unknown a priori. We revisit this well-studied problem and consider the question of how to effectively
  use (possibly erroneous) predictions of the processing times. We study this question from ground zero by first asking what
  constitutes a good prediction; we then propose a new measure to gauge prediction quality and design scheduling algorithms
  with strong guarantees under this measure. Our approach to derive a prediction error measure based on natural desiderata
  could find applications for other online problems.
