title: Robustness and Consistency in Linear Quadratic Control with Untrusted Predictions
authors: Li, Yang, Qu, Shi, Yu, Wierman, Low
abstract: We study the problem of learning-augmented predictive linear quadratic control.
  Our goal is to design a controller that balances consistency, which measures the
  competitive ratio when predictions are accurate, and robustness, which bounds the
  competitive ratio when predictions are inaccurate.
