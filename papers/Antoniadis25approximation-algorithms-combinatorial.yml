title: Approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization with predictions
authors: Antonios Antoniadis, Marek Eliás, Adam Polak, Moritz Venzin
abstract: We initiate a systematic study of utilizing predictions to improve over
  approximation guarantees of classic algorithms, without increasing the running time.
  We propose a systematic method for a wide class of optimization problems that ask
  to select a feasible subset of input items of minimal (or maximal) total weight.
  This gives simple (near-)linear time algorithms for, e.g., Vertex Cover, Steiner
  Tree, Min-Weight Perfect Matching, Knapsack, and Clique. Our algorithms produce
  optimal solutions when provided with perfect predictions and their approximation
  ratios smoothly degrade with increasing prediction error. With small enough prediction
  error we achieve approximation guarantees that are beyond reach without predictions
  in the given time bounds, as exemplified by the NP-hardness and APX-hardness of
  many of the above problems. Although we show our approach to be optimal for this
  class of problems as a whole, there is a potential for exploiting specific structural
  properties of individual problems to obtain improved bounds; we demonstrate this
  on the Steiner Tree problem. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of our approach.
