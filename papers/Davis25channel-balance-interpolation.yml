title: Channel Balance Interpolation in the Lightning Network via Machine Learning
authors: Vincent Davis, Vikash Singh, Emanuele Rossi
abstract: The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Layer 2 payment protocol that addresses
  Bitcoin’s scalability by facilitating quick and cost-effective transactions through
  payment channels. This research explores the use of machine learning models to interpolate
  channel balances within the network, which can be used for optimizing the network’s
  pathfinding algorithms. While there has been much exploration in balance probing
  and multipath payment protocols, predicting channel balances using solely node and
  channel features remains an uncharted area. This paper evaluates the performance
  of several machine learning models against two heuristic baselines and investigates
  the predictive capabilities of various features. Our model performs favorably in
  experimental evaluation, reducing the relative error by 27% compared to an equal
  split baseline where both edges are assigned half of the channel capacity.
