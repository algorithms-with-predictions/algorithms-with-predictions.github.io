title: Online bipartite matching with imperfect advice
authors: Choo, Gouleakis, Ling, Bhattacharyya
abstract: We study the problem of online unweighted bipartite matching with $n$ offline
  vertices and $n$ online vertices where one wishes to be competitive against the
  optimal offline algorithm. While the classic RANKING algorithm of Karp et al. [1990]
  provably attains competitive ratio of $1-1/e>1/2$, we show that no learning-augmented
  method can be both 1-consistent and strictly better than $1/2$-robust under the
  adversarial arrival model. Meanwhile, under the random arrival model, we show how
  one can utilize methods from distribution testing to design an algorithm that takes
  in external advice about the online vertices and provably achieves competitive ratio
  interpolating between any ratio attainable by advice-free methods and the optimal
  ratio of 1, depending on the advice quality.
