abstract: 'The realm of algorithms with predictions has led to the development of several new algorithms that leverage predictions
  to enhance their performance guarantees. The challenge is to devise algorithms that achieve optimal approximation guarantees
  as the prediction quality varies from perfect (consistency) to imperfect (robustness). This framework is particularly appealing
  in mechanism design contexts, where predictions might convey private information about the agents. In this paper, we design
  strategyproof mechanisms that leverage predictions to achieve improved approximation guarantees for several variants of
  the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) in the private graph model. In this model, first introduced by Dughmi & Ghosh (2010),
  the set of resources that an agent is compatible with is private information. For the Bipartite Matching Problem (BMP),
  we give a deterministic group-strategyproof (GSP) mechanism that is (1 + 1/γ)-consistent and (1 + γ)-robust, where γ ≥ 1
  is some confidence parameter. We also prove that this is best possible. Remarkably, our mechanism draws inspiration from
  the renowned Gale-Shapley algorithm, incorporating predictions as a crucial element. Additionally, we give a randomized
  mechanism that is universally GSP and improves on the guarantees in expectation. The other GAP variants that we consider
  all make use of a unified greedy mechanism that adds edges to the assignment according to a specific order. For a special
  case of Restricted Multiple Knapsack, this results in a deterministic strategyproof mechanism that is (1 + 1/γ)-consistent
  and (2 + γ)-robust. We then focus on two variants: Agent Size GAP (where each agent has one size) and Value Consensus GAP
  (where all agents have the same preference order over resources). For both variants, our universally GSP mechanisms randomize
  over the greedy mechanism, our mechanism for BMP and the predicted assignment, leading to (1 + 3/γ)-consistency and (3 +
  γ)-robustness in expectation. All our mechanisms also provide more fine-grained approximation guarantees that interpolate
  between the consistency and robustness guarantees, depending on some natural error measure of the prediction.'
