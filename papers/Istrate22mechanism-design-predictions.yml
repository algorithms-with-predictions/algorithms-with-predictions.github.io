title: Mechanism Design With Predictions for Obnoxious Facility Location
authors: Gabriel Istrate, Cosmin Bonchis
abstract: We study mechanism design with predictions for the obnoxious facility location problem. We present deterministic
  strategyproof mechanisms that display tradeoffs between robustness and consistency on segments, squares, circles and trees.
  All these mechanisms are actually group strategyproof, with the exception of the case of squares, where manipulations from
  coalitions of two agents exist. We prove that these tradeoffs are optimal in the 1-dimensional case.
