title: Mechanism Design With Predictions for Obnoxious Facility Location
authors: Gabriel Istrate, C. Bonchis
abstract: We study mechanism design with predictions for the obnoxious facility location
  problem. We present deterministic strategyproof mechanisms that display tradeoffs
  between robustness and consistency on segments, squares, circles and trees. All
  these mechanisms are actually group strategyproof, with the exception of the case
  of squares, where manipulations from coalitions of two agents exist. We prove that
  these tradeoffs are optimal in the 1-dimensional case.
