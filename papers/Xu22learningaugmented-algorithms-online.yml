title: Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Online Steiner Tree
authors: Chenyang Xu, Benjamin Moseley
abstract: "This paper considers the recently popular beyond-worst-case algorithm analysis model which integrates machine-learned\
  \ predictions with online algorithm design. We consider the online Steiner tree problem in this model for both directed\
  \ and undirected graphs. Steiner tree is known to have strong lower bounds in the online setting and any algorithm’s worst-case\
  \ guarantee is far from desirable.\n \n This paper considers algorithms that predict which terminal arrives online. The\
  \ predictions may be incorrect and the algorithms’ performance is parameterized by the number of incorrectly predicted terminals.\
  \ These guarantees ensure that algorithms break through the online lower bounds with good predictions and the competitive\
  \ ratio gracefully degrades as the prediction error grows. We then observe that the theory is predictive of what will occur\
  \ empirically. We show on graphs where terminals are drawn from a distribution, the new online algorithms have strong performance\
  \ even with modestly correct predictions."
