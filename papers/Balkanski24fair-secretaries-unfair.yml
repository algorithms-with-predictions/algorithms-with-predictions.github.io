title: Fair Secretaries with Unfair Predictions
authors: Balkanski, Ma, Maggiori
abstract: Algorithms with predictions is a recent framework for decision-making under
  uncertainty that leverages the power of machine-learned predictions without making
  any assumption about their quality. The goal in this framework is for algorithms
  to achieve an improved performance when the predictions are accurate while maintaining
  acceptable guarantees when the predictions are erroneous. A serious concern with
  algorithms that use predictions is that these predictions can be biased and, as
  a result, cause the algorithm to make decisions that are deemed unfair. We show
  that this concern manifests itself in the classical secretary problem in the learning-augmented
  setting -- the state-of-the-art algorithm can have zero probability of accepting
  the best candidate, which we deem unfair, despite promising to accept a candidate
  whose expected value is at least $\max\{\Omega (1) , 1 - O(\epsilon)\}$ times the
  optimal value, where $\epsilon$ is the prediction error. We show how to preserve
  this promise while also guaranteeing to accept the best candidate with probability
  $\Omega(1)$. Our algorithm and analysis are based on a new"pegging"idea that diverges
  from existing works and simplifies/unifies some of their results. Finally, we extend
  to the $k$-secretary problem and complement our theoretical analysis with experiments.
