title: Online Resource Allocation with Convex-set Machine-Learned Advice
authors: Negin Golrezaei, P. Jaillet, Zijie Zhou
abstract: Decision-makers often have access to a machine-learned prediction about
  demand, referred to as advice, which can potentially be utilized in online decision-making
  processes for resource allocation. However, exploiting such advice poses challenges
  due to its potential inaccuracy. To address this issue, we propose a framework that
  enhances online resource allocation decisions with potentially unreliable machine-learned
  (ML) advice. We assume here that this advice is represented by a general convex
  uncertainty set for the demand vector. We introduce a parameterized class of Pareto
  optimal online resource allocation algorithms that strike a balance between consistent
  and robust ratios. The consistent ratio measures the algorithm's performance (compared
  to the optimal hindsight solution) when the ML advice is accurate, while the robust
  ratio captures performance under an adversarial demand process when the advice is
  inaccurate. Specifically, in a C-Pareto optimal setting, we maximize the robust
  ratio while ensuring that the consistent ratio is at least C. Our proposed C-Pareto
  optimal algorithm is an adaptive protection level algorithm, which extends the classical
  fixed protection level algorithm introduced in Littlewood (2005) and Ball and Queyranne
  (2009). Solving a complex non-convex continuous optimization problem characterizes
  the adaptive protection level algorithm. To complement our algorithms, we present
  a simple method for computing the maximum achievable consistent ratio, which serves
  as an estimate for the maximum value of the ML advice. Additionally, we present
  numerical studies to evaluate the performance of our algorithm in comparison to
  benchmark algorithms. The results demonstrate that by adjusting the parameter C,
  our algorithms effectively strike a balance between worst-case and average performance,
  outperforming the benchmark algorithms.
