abstract: 'We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT) problem, a new framework that integrates
  three key objectives in online decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a dynamically moving target,
  (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
  changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in
  AI clusters, where operators must balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden demand
  spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT.
  To enhance practical performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box
  predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves
  over BEST when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary prediction errors. We validate our
  approach through a case study on workload scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
  tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.'
