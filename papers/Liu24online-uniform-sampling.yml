abstract: Motivated by applications in digital health, this work studies the novel
  problem of online uniform sampling (OUS), where the goal is to distribute a sampling
  budget uniformly across unknown decision times. In the OUS problem, the algorithm
  is given a budget $b$ and a time horizon $T$, and an adversary then chooses a value
  $\tau^* \in [b,T]$, which is revealed to the algorithm online. At each decision
  time $i \in [\tau^*]$, the algorithm must determine a sampling probability that
  maximizes the budget spent throughout the horizon, respecting budget constraint
  $b$, while achieving as uniform a distribution as possible over $\tau^*$. We present
  the first randomized algorithm designed for this problem and subsequently extend
  it to incorporate learning augmentation. We provide worst-case approximation guarantees
  for both algorithms, and illustrate the utility of the algorithms through both synthetic
  experiments and a real-world case study involving the HeartSteps mobile application.
  Our numerical results show strong empirical average performance of our proposed
  randomized algorithms against previously proposed heuristic solutions.
