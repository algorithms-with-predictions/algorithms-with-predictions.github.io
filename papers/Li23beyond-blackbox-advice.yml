abstract: We study the tradeoff between consistency and robustness in the context of a single-trajectory time-varying Markov
  Decision Process (MDP) with untrusted machine-learned advice. Our work departs from the typical approach of treating advice
  as coming from black-box sources by instead considering a setting where additional information about how the advice is generated
  is available. We prove a first-of-its-kind consistency and robustness tradeoff given Q-value advice under a general MDP
  model that includes both continuous and discrete state/action spaces. Our results highlight that utilizing Q-value advice
  enables dynamic pursuit of the better of machine-learned advice and a robust baseline, thus result in near-optimal performance
  guarantees, which provably improves what can be obtained solely with black-box advice.
