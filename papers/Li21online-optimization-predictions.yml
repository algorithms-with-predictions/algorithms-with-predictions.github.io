abstract: 'This paper studies an online optimization problem with a finite prediction window of cost functions and additional
  switching costs on decisions. We propose two gradient-based online algorithms: Receding Horizon Gradient Descent (RHGD),
  and Receding Horizon Accelerated Gradient (RHAG). Both algorithms only require a finite number of projected gradient evaluations
  at each stage. We provide upper bounds on the dynamic regrets of the proposed algorithms and show that the regret upper
  bounds decay exponentially with the length of the prediction window. Moreover, we study the fundamental lower bound on the
  dynamic regret for a broad class of deterministic online algorithms. The lower bound is close to RHAG''s regret upper bound,
  indicating that our gradient-based RHAG is a near-optimal online algorithm. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to
  complement our theoretical analysis.'
