abstract: 'We study single-machine scheduling of jobs, each belonging to a job type
  that determines its duration distribution. We start by analyzing the scenario where
  the type characteristics are known and then move to two learning scenarios where
  the types are unknown: non-preemptive problems, where each started job must be completed
  before moving to another job; and preemptive problems, where job execution can be
  paused in the favor of moving to a different job. In both cases, we design algorithms
  that achieve sublinear excess cost, compared to the performance with known types,
  and prove lower bounds for the non-preemptive case. Notably, we demonstrate, both
  theoretically and through simulations, how preemptive algorithms can greatly outperform
  non-preemptive ones when the durations of different job types are far from one another,
  a phenomenon that does not occur when the type durations are known.'
