title: Interval Selection with Binary Predictions
authors: Christodoulos Karavasilis
abstract: 'Following a line of work that takes advantage of vast machine-learned data
  to enhance online algorithms with (possibly erroneous) information about future
  inputs, we consider predictions in the context of deterministic algorithms for the
  problem of selecting a maximum weight independent set of intervals arriving on the
  real line. We look at two weight functions, unit (constant) weights, and weights
  proportional to the interval’s length. In the classical online model of irrevocable
  decisions, no algorithm can achieve constant competitiveness. In this setting, we
  show that a simple algorithm that is faithful to the predictions is optimal, and
  achieves an objective value of at least OPT - η, with η being the total error in
  the predictions, both for unit, and proportional weights.


  When revocable acceptances (a form of preemption) are allowed, the optimal deterministic
  algorithm for unit weights is 2k-competitive, where k is the number of different
  interval lengths. We give an algorithm with performance OPT − η (and therefore 1-consistent),
  that is also (2k + 1)-robust. For proportional weights, there is an optimal (2φ
  + 1)-competitive algorithm, where φ is the golden ratio. We present an algorithm
  with parameter λ > 1 that is 3λ / (λ - 1) -consistent, and (4λ^2 + 2λ) / (λ - 1)-robust.
  Although these bounds are not tight, we show that for λ > 3.42 we achieve consistency
  better than the optimal online guarantee, while maintaining bounded robustness.


  We conclude with some experimental results on real-world data that complement our
  theoretical findings, and show the benefit of prediction algorithms for online interval
  selection, even in the presence of high error.'
