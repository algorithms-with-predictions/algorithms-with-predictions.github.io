abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated immediately
  and irrevocably to agents. Prior work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness notions,
  such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good
  (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three
  natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary.
  This is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known
  to be able to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of non-adaptive
  adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries,
  we show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation with high probability.
  Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum
  item value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable
  even with perfect MIV predictions.
