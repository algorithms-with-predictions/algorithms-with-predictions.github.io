abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
  sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
  work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness
  notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast,
  we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality
  whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three natural
  greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general,
  against an adaptive adversary. This is surprising because greedy algorithms are
  commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able
  to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result
  motivates the study of non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information,
  in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we
  show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1
  approximation with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain
  robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum
  item value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such
  as EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.
