title: Signal-Aware Workload Shifting Algorithms with Uncertainty-Quantified Predictors
authors: Ezra Johnson, Adam Lechowicz, Mohammad Hajiesmaili
abstract: 'A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on workload shifting, which aligns the timing
  of energy consumption with external signals such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use electricity
  prices. The main challenge lies in the online nature of the problem: operators must make real-time decisions (e.g., whether
  to consume energy now) without knowledge of the future. While forecasts of signal values are typically available, prior
  work on learning-augmented online algorithms has relied almost exclusively on simple point forecasts. In parallel, the forecasting
  research has made significant progress in uncertainty quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive
  information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage UQ predictors to improve decision-making.
  We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a learning-augmented algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts through a
  $\textit{decision uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast uncertainty affects optimal future decisions. By introducing
  $\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes how performance degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish
  theoretical performance guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on carbon intensity
  and electricity price data, we demonstrate that $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$ consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing
  learning-augmented methods that ignore uncertainty.'
