title: Signal-Aware Workload Shifting Algorithms with Uncertainty-Quantified Predictors
authors: Johnson, Lechowicz, Hajiesmaili
abstract: 'A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on
  workload shifting, which aligns the timing of energy consumption with external signals
  such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use electricity prices.
  The main challenge lies in the online nature of the problem: operators must make
  real-time decisions (e.g., whether to consume energy now) without knowledge of the
  future. While forecasts of signal values are typically available, prior work on
  learning-augmented online algorithms has relied almost exclusively on simple point
  forecasts. In parallel, the forecasting research has made significant progress in
  uncertainty quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive
  information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage UQ
  predictors to improve decision-making. We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a learning-augmented
  algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts through a $\textit{decision
  uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast uncertainty affects optimal future
  decisions. By introducing $\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes
  how performance degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish theoretical performance
  guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on
  carbon intensity and electricity price data, we demonstrate that $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$
  consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing learning-augmented methods
  that ignore uncertainty.'
