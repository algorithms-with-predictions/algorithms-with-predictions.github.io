title: Flow Time Scheduling with Uncertain Processing Time
authors: Y. Azar, S. Leonardi, Noam Touitou
abstract: We consider the problem of online scheduling on a single machine in order to minimize weighted flow time. The existing
  algorithms for this problem (STOC ’01, SODA ’03, FOCS ’18) all require exact knowledge of the processing time of each job.
  This assumption is crucial, as even a slight perturbation of the processing time would lead to polynomial competitive ratio.
  However, this assumption very rarely holds in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we present the first algorithm for weighted
  flow time which do not require exact knowledge of the processing times of jobs. Specifically, we introduce the Scheduling
  with Predicted Processing Time (SPPT) problem, where the algorithm is given a prediction for the processing time of each
  job, instead of its real processing time. For the case of a constant factor distortion between the predictions and the real
  processing time, our algorithms match all the best known competitiveness bounds for weighted flow time – namely O(logP),
  O(logD) and O(logW), where P,D,W are the maximum ratios of processing times, densities, and weights, respectively. For larger
  errors, the competitiveness of our algorithms degrades gracefully.
