title: Online Graph Algorithms with Predictions
authors: Azar, Panigrahi, Touitou
abstract: 'Online algorithms with predictions is a popular and elegant framework for
  bypassing pessimistic lower bounds in competitive analysis. In this model, online
  algorithms are supplied with future predictions, and the goal is for the competitive
  ratio to smoothly interpolate between the best offline and online bounds as a function
  of the prediction error. In this paper, we study online graph problems with predictions.
  Our contributions are the following: * The first question is defining prediction
  error. For graph/metric problems, there can be two types of error, locations that
  are not predicted, and locations that are predicted but the predicted and actual
  locations do not coincide exactly. We design a novel definition of prediction error
  called metric error with outliers to simultaneously capture both types of errors,
  which thereby generalizes previous definitions of error that only capture one of
  the two error types. * We give a general framework for obtaining online algorithms
  with predictions that combines, in a"black box"fashion, existing online and offline
  algorithms, under certain technical conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first general-purpose tool for obtaining online algorithms with predictions.
  * Using our framework, we obtain tight bounds on the competitive ratio of several
  classical graph problems as a function of metric error with outliers: Steiner tree,
  Steiner forest, priority Steiner tree/forest, and uncapacitated/capacitated facility
  location. Both the definition of metric error with outliers and the general framework
  for combining offline and online algorithms are not specific to the problems that
  we consider in this paper. We hope that these will be useful for future work in
  this domain.'
