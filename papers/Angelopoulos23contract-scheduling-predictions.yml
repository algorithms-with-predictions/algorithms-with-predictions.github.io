title: Contract scheduling with predictions
authors: Spyros Angelopoulos, Shahin Kamali
abstract: Contract scheduling is a general technique that allows to design a system with interruptible capabilities, given
  an algorithm that is not necessarily interruptible. Previous work on this topic has largely assumed that the interruption
  is a worst-case deadline that is unknown to the scheduler. In this work, we study the setting in which there is a potentially
  erroneous prediction concerning the interruption. Specifically, we consider the setting in which the prediction describes
  the time that the interruption occurs, as well as the setting in which the prediction is obtained as a response to a single
  or multiple binary queries. For both settings, we investigate tradeoffs between the robustness (i.e., the worst-case performance
  assuming adversarial prediction) and the consistency (i.e, the performance assuming that the prediction is error-free),
  both from the side of positive and negative results.
