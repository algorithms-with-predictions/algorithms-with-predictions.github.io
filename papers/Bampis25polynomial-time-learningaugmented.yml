abstract: We consider a learning-augmented framework for NP-hard permutation problems. The algorithm has access to predictions
  telling, given a pair $u,v$ of elements, whether $u$ is before $v$ or not in an optimal solution. Building on the work of
  Braverman and Mossel (SODA 2008), we show that for a class of optimization problems including scheduling, network design
  and other graph permutation problems, these predictions allow to solve them in polynomial time with high probability, provided
  that predictions are true with probability at least $1/2+\epsilon$. Moreover, this can be achieved with a parsimonious access
  to the predictions.
