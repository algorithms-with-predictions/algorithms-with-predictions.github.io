title: Prediction Augmented Segment Routing
authors: Murali S. Kodialam, T. V. Lakshman
abstract: With the increasing success of machine learning based approaches for prediction problems, there has been recent
  effort in improving the performance of online algorithms by augmenting them with machine learning predictions. Since machine
  learning predictions typically do not offer any performance guarantees, the new approach has to take into consideration
  the possibility that the machine learning prediction can be inaccurate. The idea is to develop approaches that give good
  results when the prediction is accurate (consistency) while ensuring that the performance is still acceptable in the worst
  case, when the prediction is not accurate (robustness). Segment routing is now being widely deployed and used for traffic
  engineering in IP networks. The key idea in segment routing is to break up the routing path into segments to better control
  routing paths and improve network utilization. We consider the problem of designing the segments in a network to minimize
  congestion. This is typically done for a predicted traffic matrix. We use the ideas of consistency and robustness to design
  a parametrized algorithm that gives good performance when the actual traffic matrix is exactly the predicted traffic matrix
  (consistency) while giving good performance in the worst case if the actual traffic matrix deviates significantly from the
  predicted traffic matrix (robustness).
