title: Efficient Approximate Temporal Triangle Counting in Streaming with Predictions
authors: Giorgio Venturin, Ilie Sarpe, Fabio Vandin
abstract: Triangle counting is a fundamental and widely studied problem on static
  graphs, and recently on temporal graphs, where edges carry information on the timings
  of the associated events. Streaming processing and resource efficiency are crucial
  requirements for counting triangles in modern massive temporal graphs, with millions
  of nodes and up to billions of temporal edges. However, current exact and approximate
  algorithms are unable to handle large-scale temporal graphs. To fill such a gap,
  we introduce STEP, a scalable and efficient algorithm to approximate temporal triangle
  counts from a stream of temporal edges. STEP combines predictions to the number
  of triangles a temporal edge is involved in, with a simple sampling strategy, leading
  to scalability, efficiency, and accurate approximation of all eight temporal triangle
  types simultaneously. We analytically prove that, by using a sublinear amount of
  memory, STEP obtains unbiased and very accurate estimates. In fact, even noisy predictions
  can significantly reduce the variance of STEP's estimates. Our extensive experiments
  on massive temporal graphs with up to billions of edges demonstrate that STEP outputs
  high-quality estimates and is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods.
