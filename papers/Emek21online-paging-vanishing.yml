title: Online Paging with a Vanishing Regret
authors: Yuval Emek, Shay Kutten, Yangguang Shi
abstract: "This paper considers a variant of the online paging problem, where the online algorithm has access to multiple\
  \ predictors, each producing a sequence of predictions for the page arrival times. The predictors may have occasional prediction\
  \ errors and it is assumed that at least one of them makes a sublinear number of prediction errors in total. Our main result\
  \ states that this assumption suffices for the design of a randomized online algorithm whose time-average regret with respect\
  \ to the optimal offline algorithm tends to zero as the time tends to infinity. This holds (with different regret bounds)\
  \ for both the full information access model, where in each round, the online algorithm gets the predictions of all predictors,\
  \ and the bandit access model, where in each round, the online algorithm queries a single predictor. \nWhile online algorithms\
  \ that exploit inaccurate predictions have been a topic of growing interest in the last few years, to the best of our knowledge,\
  \ this is the first paper that studies this topic in the context of multiple predictors. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,\
  \ this is also the first paper that aims for (and achieves) online algorithms with a vanishing regret for a classic online\
  \ problem under reasonable assumptions."
