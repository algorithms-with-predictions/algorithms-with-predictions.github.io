title: 'Online Bipartite Matching with Advice: Tight Robustness-Consistency Tradeoffs
  for the Two-Stage Model'
authors: Billy Jin, Will Ma
abstract: 'Two-stage bipartite matching is a fundamental problem of optimization under
  uncertainty introduced by Feng, Niazadeh, and Saberi (2021), who study it under
  the stochastic and adversarial paradigms of uncertainty. We propose a method to
  interpolate between these paradigms, using the Algorithms with Predictions (ALPS)
  framework. To elaborate, given some form of information (e.g. a distributional prediction)
  about the uncertainty, we consider the optimal decision assuming that information
  is correct to be some"advice", whose accuracy is unknown. In the ALPS framework,
  we define Consistency to be an algorithm''s performance relative to the advice,
  and Robustness to be an algorithm''s performance relative to the hindsight-optimal
  decision. We characterize the tight tradeoff between Consistency and Robustness
  for four settings of two-stage matching: unweighted, vertex-weighted, edge-weighted,
  and fractional budgeted allocation. Additionally, we show our algorithm achieves
  state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real-data simulations.'
