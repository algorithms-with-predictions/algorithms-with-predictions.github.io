title: Online Fair Division with Additional Information
authors: Tzeh Yuan Neoh, Jannik Peters, Nicholas Teh
abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in
  an online setting, where goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated irrevocably
  to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of envy-freeness, proportionality,
  and maximin share fairness (and their approximate variants), we ask how the availability
  of information on future goods influences the existence and approximability of fair
  allocations. In the absence of any such information, we establish strong impossibility
  results, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness
  guarantees. In contrast, we demonstrate that knowledge of additional information
  -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations (equivalently, normalized
  valuations) or the multiset of future goods values (frequency predictions) -- would
  enable the design of fairer online algorithms. Given normalization information,
  we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger fairness guarantees than previously
  known results. Given frequency predictions, we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages
  frequency predictions to match the best-known offline guarantees for a broad class
  of ''share-based'' fairness notions. Our complementary impossibility results in
  each setting underscore both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future
  goods and the potential of leveraging structured information to achieve fairer outcomes
  in online fair division.
