title: Online Fair Division with Additional Information
authors: Tzeh Yuan Neoh, Jannik Peters, Nicholas Teh
abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in an online setting, where goods arrive sequentially
  and must be allocated irrevocably to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of envy-freeness, proportionality,
  and maximin share fairness (and their approximate variants), we ask how the availability of information on future goods
  influences the existence and approximability of fair allocations. In the absence of any such information, we establish strong
  impossibility results, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness guarantees. In contrast,
  we demonstrate that knowledge of additional information -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations (equivalently,
  normalized valuations) or the multiset of future goods values (frequency predictions) -- would enable the design of fairer
  online algorithms. Given normalization information, we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger fairness guarantees than
  previously known results. Given frequency predictions, we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages frequency predictions
  to match the best-known offline guarantees for a broad class of ''share-based'' fairness notions. Our complementary impossibility
  results in each setting underscore both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future goods and the potential of leveraging
  structured information to achieve fairer outcomes in online fair division.
