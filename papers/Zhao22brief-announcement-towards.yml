abstract: We consider the problem of non-clairvoyant scheduling on single machine
  to minimize the total flow time with job size predictions. The existing algorithm
  achieves 2-consistency to predictions, but no algorithm can simultaneously attain
  bounded robustness. This work finds a sufficient condition for any algorithm to
  achieve optimal O(P)-robustness, where P is the maximum ratio of any two job sizes.
  We give the first algorithm that achieves optimal robustness up to a constant multiplicative
  factor and optimal consistency using this condition. Finally, for addressing small
  prediction errors, we present an algorithm that we conjecture to achieve the optimal
  O(η^2) competitive ratio, where η is the prediction error. Proving the claimed bound
  is our ongoing work.
