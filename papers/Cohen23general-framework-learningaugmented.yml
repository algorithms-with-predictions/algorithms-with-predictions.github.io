title: A General Framework for Learning-Augmented Online Allocation
authors: Ilan Reuven Cohen, Debmalya Panigrahi
abstract: Online allocation is a broad class of problems where items arriving online have to be allocated to agents who have
  a fixed utility/cost for each assigned item so to maximize/minimize some objective. This framework captures a broad range
  of fundamental problems such as the Santa Claus problem (maximizing minimum utility), Nash welfare maximization (maximizing
  geometric mean of utilities), makespan minimization (minimizing maximum cost), minimization of $\ell_p$-norms, and so on.
  We focus on divisible items (i.e., fractional allocations) in this paper. Even for divisible items, these problems are characterized
  by strong super-constant lower bounds in the classical worst-case online model. In this paper, we study online allocations
  in the {\em learning-augmented} setting, i.e., where the algorithm has access to some additional (machine-learned) information
  about the problem instance. We introduce a {\em general} algorithmic framework for learning-augmented online allocation
  that produces nearly optimal solutions for this broad range of maximization and minimization objectives using only a single
  learned parameter for every agent. As corollaries of our general framework, we improve prior results of Lattanzi et al.
  (SODA 2020) and Li and Xian (ICML 2021) for learning-augmented makespan minimization, and obtain the first learning-augmented
  nearly-optimal algorithms for the other objectives such as Santa Claus, Nash welfare, $\ell_p$-minimization, etc. We also
  give tight bounds on the resilience of our algorithms to errors in the learned parameters, and study the learnability of
  these parameters.
