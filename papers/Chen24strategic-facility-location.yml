title: Strategic Facility Location via Predictions
authors: Qingyun Chen, Nick Gravin, Sungjin Im
abstract: The facility location with strategic agents is a canonical problem in the literature on mechanism design without
  money. Recently, Agrawal et. al. considered this problem in the context of machine learning augmented algorithms, where
  the mechanism designer is also given a prediction of the optimal facility location. An ideal mechanism in this framework
  produces an outcome that is close to the social optimum when the prediction is accurate (consistency) and gracefully degrades
  as the prediction deviates from the truth, while retaining some of the worst-case approximation guarantees (robustness).
  The previous work only addressed this problem in the two-dimensional Euclidean space providing optimal trade-offs between
  robustness and consistency guarantees for deterministic mechanisms. We consider the problem for \emph{general} metric spaces.
  Our only assumption is that the metric is continuous, meaning that any pair of points must be connected by a continuous
  shortest path. We introduce a novel mechanism that in addition to agents' reported locations takes a predicted optimal facility
  location $\hat{o}$. We call this mechanism $\texttt{Harmonic}$, as it selects one of the reported locations $\tilde{\ell}_i$
  with probability inversely proportional to $d(\hat{o},\tilde{\ell}_i)+ \Delta$ for a constant parameter $\Delta$. While
  \harm \ mechanism is not truthful, we can \emph{characterize the set of undominated strategies} for each agent $i$ as solely
  consisting of the points on a shortest path from their true location $\ell_i$ to the predicted location $\hat{o}$. We further
  derive \emph{consistency and robustness guarantees on the Price of Anarchy (PoA)} for the game induced by the mechanism.
