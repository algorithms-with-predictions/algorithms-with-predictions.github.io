title: 'PCF Learned Sort: a Learning Augmented Sort Algorithm with O(n log log n)
  Expected Complexity'
authors: Sato, Matsui
abstract: Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science. Recently,
  Learned Sorts, which use machine learning to improve sorting speed, have attracted
  attention. While existing studies show that Learned Sort is experimentally faster
  than classical sorting algorithms, they do not provide theoretical guarantees about
  its computational complexity. We propose PCF Learned Sort, a theoretically guaranteed
  Learned Sort algorithm. We prove that the expected complexity of PCF Learned Sort
  is $O(n \log \log n)$ under mild assumptions on the data distribution. We also confirm
  experimentally that PCF Learned Sort has a computational complexity of $O(n \log
  \log n)$ on both synthetic and real datasets. This is the first study to theoretically
  support the experimental success of Learned Sort, and provides evidence for why
  Learned Sort is fast.
