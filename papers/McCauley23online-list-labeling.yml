title: Online List Labeling with Predictions

abstract: 'A growing line of work shows how learned predictions can be used to break
  through worst-case barriers to improve the running time of an algorithm. However,
  incorporating predictions into data structures with strong theoretical guarantees
  remains underdeveloped. This paper takes a step in this direction by showing that
  predictions can be leveraged in the fundamental online list labeling problem. In
  the problem, n items arrive over time and must be stored in sorted order in an array
  of size Theta(n). The array slot of an element is its label and the goal is to maintain
  sorted order while minimizing the total number of elements moved (i.e., relabeled).
  We design a new list labeling data structure and bound its performance in two models.
  In the worst-case learning-augmented model, we give guarantees in terms of the error
  in the predictions. Our data structure provides strong guarantees: it is optimal
  for any prediction error and guarantees the best-known worst-case bound even when
  the predictions are entirely erroneous. We also consider a stochastic error model
  and bound the performance in terms of the expectation and variance of the error.
  Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated empirically. In particular, we
  show that our data structure has strong performance on real temporal data sets where
  predictions are constructed from elements that arrived in the past, as is typically
  done in a practical use case.'
