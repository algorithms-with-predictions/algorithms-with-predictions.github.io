abstract:
  "As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations'Sustainable
  Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
  is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare services.
  However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort can be implemented
  each year due to limited budgets and other competing priorities, thus the need for
  an optimization framework to guide prioritization across the regions of Ethiopia.
  In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access Resource Planner (HARP), based on
  a principled decision-support optimization framework for sequential facility planning
  that aims to maximize population coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying
  region-specific proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two
  algorithms: (i) a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations
  at any single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
  strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
  Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical efficacy
  of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios."
