abstract: 'The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for
  this problem of $1/\mathrm{e} \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s. Much more recently, the study of algorithms
  with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront
  which can be used to improve the algorithm''s performance. Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior
  knowledge, we tackle the following question: What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/\mathrm{e}$
  barrier? To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap. As in the classical problem, weights
  are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order. In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm
  only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an \emph{additive gap} $c$. This gap is the difference between the
  highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence. Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does
  not make the problem trivial. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can
  obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent
  bound for the classical problem by a constant. Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard
  robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction.'
