title: Distortion-Oblivious Algorithms for Minimizing Flow Time
authors: Yossi Azar, Stefano Leonardi, Noam Touitou
abstract: 'We consider the classic online problem of scheduling on a single machine to minimize total flow time. In STOC 2021,
  the concept of robustness to distortion in processing times was introduced: for every distortion factor $\mu$, an $O(\mu^2)$-competitive
  algorithm $\operatorname{ALG}_{\mu}$ which handles distortions up to $\mu$ was presented. However, using that result requires
  one to know the distortion of the input in advance, which is impractical. We present the first \emph{distortion-oblivious}
  algorithms: algorithms which are competitive for \emph{every} input of \emph{every} distortion, and thus do not require
  knowledge of the distortion in advance. Moreover, the competitive ratios of our algorithms are $\tilde{O}(\mu)$, which is
  a quadratic improvement over the algorithm from STOC 2021, and is nearly optimal (we show a randomized lower bound of $\Omega(\mu)$
  on competitiveness).'
