abstract: 'Paging is a prototypical problem in the area of online algorithms. It has also played a central role in the development
  of learning-augmented algorithms -- a recent line of research that aims to ameliorate the shortcomings of classical worst-case
  analysis by giving algorithms access to predictions. Such predictions can typically be generated using a machine learning
  approach, but they are inherently imperfect. Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on
  (i) when the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an
  optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative
  order in which pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the least possible
  amount of predicted information. More specifically, the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to
  one bit only. We consider two natural such setups: (i) discard predictions, in which the predicted bit denotes whether or
  not it is ``safe'''' to evict this page, and (ii) phase predictions, where the bit denotes whether the current page will
  be requested in the next phase (for an appropriate partitioning of the input into phases). We develop algorithms for each
  of the two setups that satisfy all three desirable properties of learning-augmented algorithms -- that is, they are consistent,
  robust and smooth -- despite being limited to a one-bit prediction per request. We also present lower bounds establishing
  that our algorithms are essentially best possible.'
