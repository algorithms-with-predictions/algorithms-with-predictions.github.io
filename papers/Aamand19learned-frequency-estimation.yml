title: (Learned) Frequency Estimation Algorithms under Zipfian Distribution
authors: Aamand, Indyk, Vakilian
abstract: "The frequencies of the elements in a data stream are an important statistical\
  \ measure and the task of estimating them arises in many applications within data\
  \ analysis and machine learning. Two of the most popular algorithms for this problem,\
  \ Count-Min and Count-Sketch, are widely used in practice. \nIn a recent work [Hsu\
  \ et al., ICLR'19], it was shown empirically that augmenting Count-Min and Count-Sketch\
  \ with a machine learning algorithm leads to a significant reduction of the estimation\
  \ error. The experiments were complemented with an analysis of the expected error\
  \ incurred by Count-Min (both the standard and the augmented version) when the input\
  \ frequencies follow a Zipfian distribution. Although the authors established that\
  \ the learned version of Count-Min has lower estimation error than its standard\
  \ counterpart, their analysis of the standard Count-Min algorithm was not tight.\
  \ Moreover, they provided no similar analysis for Count-Sketch. \nIn this paper\
  \ we resolve these problems. First, we provide a simple tight analysis of the expected\
  \ error incurred by Count-Min. Second, we provide the first error bounds for both\
  \ the standard and the augmented version of Count-Sketch. These bounds are nearly\
  \ tight and again demonstrate an improved performance of the learned version of\
  \ Count-Sketch. \nIn addition to demonstrating tight gaps between the aforementioned\
  \ algorithms, we believe that our bounds for the standard versions of Count-Min\
  \ and Count-Sketch are of independent interest. In particular, it is a typical practice\
  \ to set the number of hash functions in those algorithms to $\\Theta (\\log n)$.\
  \ In contrast, our results show that to minimise the \\emph{expected} error, the\
  \ number of hash functions should be a constant, strictly greater than $1$."
