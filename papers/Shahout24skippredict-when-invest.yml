title: 'SkipPredict: When to Invest in Predictions for Scheduling'
authors: Rana Shahout, Michael Mitzenmacher
abstract: In light of recent work on scheduling with predicted job sizes, we consider
  the effect of the cost of predictions in queueing systems, removing the assumption
  in prior research that predictions are external to the system's resources and/or
  cost-free. In particular, we introduce a novel approach to utilizing predictions,
  SkipPredict, designed to address their inherent cost. Rather than uniformly applying
  predictions to all jobs, we propose a tailored approach that categorizes jobs based
  on their prediction requirements. To achieve this, we employ one-bit"cheap predictions"to
  classify jobs as either short or long. SkipPredict prioritizes predicted short jobs
  over long jobs, and for the latter, SkipPredict applies a second round of more detailed"expensive
  predictions"to approximate Shortest Remaining Processing Time for these jobs. Our
  analysis takes into account the cost of prediction. We examine the effect of this
  cost for two distinct models. In the external cost model, predictions are generated
  by some external method without impacting job service times but incur a cost. In
  the server time cost model, predictions themselves require server processing time,
  and are scheduled on the same server as the jobs.
