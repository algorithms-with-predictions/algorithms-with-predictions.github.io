title: Scheduling with Untrusted Predictions
authors: Bampis, Dogeas, Kononov, Lucarelli, Pascual
abstract: Using machine-learned predictions to create algorithms with better approximation
  guarantees is a very fresh and active field. In this work, we study classic scheduling
  problems under the learning augmented setting. More specifically, we consider the
  problem of scheduling jobs with arbitrary release dates on a single machine and
  the problem of scheduling jobs with a common release date on multiple machines.
  Our objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. For both problems, we
  propose algorithms which use predictions for taking their decisions. Our algorithms
  are consistent -- i.e. when the predictions are accurate, the performances of our
  algorithms are close to those of an optimal offline algorithm--, and robust -- i.e.
  when the predictions are wrong, the performance of our algorithms are close to those
  of an online algorithm without predictions. In addition, we confirm the above theoretical
  bounds by conducting experimental evaluation comparing the proposed algorithms to
  the offline optimal ones for both the single and multiple machines settings.
