title: A short note about the learning-augmented secretary problem
authors: Davin Choo, Chun Kai Ling
abstract: We consider the secretary problem through the lens of learning-augmented algorithms. As it is known that the best
  possible expected competitive ratio is $1/e$ in the classic setting without predictions, a natural goal is to design algorithms
  that are 1-consistent and $1/e$-robust. Unfortunately, [FY24] provided hardness constructions showing that such a goal is
  not attainable when the candidates' true values are allowed to scale with $n$. Here, we provide a simple and explicit alternative
  hardness construction showing that such a goal is not achievable even when the candidates' true values are constants that
  do not scale with $n$.
