abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the number of distinct elements in a large data set (or, equivalently, the
  support size of the distribution induced by the data set) from a random sample of its elements. The problem occurs in many
  applications, including biology, genomics, computer systems and linguistics. A line of research spanning the last decade
  resulted in algorithms that estimate the support up to $ \pm \varepsilon n$ from a sample of size $O(\log^2(1/\varepsilon)
  \cdot n/\log n)$, where $n$ is the data set size. Unfortunately, this bound is known to be tight, limiting further improvements
  to the complexity of this problem. In this paper we consider estimation algorithms augmented with a machine-learning-based
  predictor that, given any element, returns an estimation of its frequency. We show that if the predictor is correct up to
  a constant approximation factor, then the sample complexity can be reduced significantly, to \[ \ \log (1/\varepsilon) \cdot
  n^{1-\Theta(1/\log(1/\varepsilon))}. \] We evaluate the proposed algorithms on a collection of data sets, using the neural-network
  based estimators from {Hsu et al, ICLR'19} as predictors. Our experiments demonstrate substantial (up to 3x) improvements
  in the estimation accuracy compared to the state of the art algorithm.
