abstract: 'We study the Online Traveling Salesperson Problem (OLTSP) with predictions. In OLTSP, a sequence of initially unknown
  requests arrive over time at points (locations) of a metric space. The goal is, starting from a particular point of the
  metric space (the origin), to serve all these requests while minimizing the total time spent. The server moves with unit
  speed or is"waiting"(zero speed) at some location. We consider two variants: in the open variant, the goal is achieved when
  the last request is served. In the closed one, the server additionally has to return to the origin. We adopt a prediction
  model, introduced for OLTSP on the line, in which the predictions correspond to the locations of the requests and extend
  it to more general metric spaces. We first propose an oracle-based algorithmic framework, inspired by previous work. This
  framework allows us to design online algorithms for general metric spaces that provide competitive ratio guarantees which,
  given perfect predictions, beat the best possible classical guarantee (consistency). Moreover, they degrade gracefully along
  with the increase in error (smoothness), but always within a constant factor of the best known competitive ratio in the
  classical case (robustness). Having reduced the problem to designing suitable efficient oracles, we describe how to achieve
  this for general metric spaces as well as specific metric spaces (rings, trees and flowers), the resulting algorithms being
  tractable in the latter case. The consistency guarantees of our algorithms are tight in almost all cases, and their smoothness
  guarantees only suffer a linear dependency on the error, which we show is necessary. Finally, we provide robustness guarantees
  improving previous results.'
