title: Privacy-Preserving Learning-Augmented Data Structures
authors: Prabhav Goyal, Vinesh Sridhar, Wilson Zheng
abstract: 'Learning-augmented data structures use predicted frequency estimates to retrieve frequently occurring database
  elements faster than standard data structures. Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit these frequency
  estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial prediction errors. However, the privacy and security implications
  of this setting remain largely unexplored. In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal information
  beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for learning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to
  the data. A data structure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no information about past operations
  except what is inferred from its current contents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security guarantees
  in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data structure that is strongly history independent, robust, and
  supports dynamic updates. To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which automatically makes any learning-augmented
  data structure robust, and pairing, a simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic setting.
  Our experimental results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and efficiency but are still competitive with the state
  of the art.'
