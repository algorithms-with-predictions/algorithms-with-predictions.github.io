abstract: 'Learning-augmented data structures use predicted frequency estimates to
  retrieve frequently occurring database elements faster than standard data structures.
  Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit these frequency
  estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial prediction errors. However,
  the privacy and security implications of this setting remain largely unexplored.
  In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal information
  beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for learning-augmented
  data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data structure is history independent
  if its memory representation reveals no information about past operations except
  what is inferred from its current contents. In this work, we take the first step
  towards privacy and security guarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented
  data structure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic
  updates. To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which automatically
  makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing, a simple technique
  that provides strong history independence in the dynamic setting. Our experimental
  results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and efficiency but are still competitive
  with the state of the art.'
