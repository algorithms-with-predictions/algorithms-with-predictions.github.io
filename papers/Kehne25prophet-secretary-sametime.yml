title: Prophet and Secretary at the Same Time
authors: Gregory Kehne, Thomas Kesselheim
abstract: 'Many online problems are studied in stochastic settings for which inputs
  are samples from a known  distribution, given in advance, or from an unknown distribution.
  Such distributions model both beyond-worst-case inputs and, when given, partial
  foreknowledge for the online algorithm. But how robust can such algorithms be to
  misspecification of the given distribution? When is this detectable, and when does
  it matter? When can algorithms give good competitive ratios both when the input
  distribution is as specified, and when it is not? We consider these questions in
  the setting of optimal stopping, where the cases of known and unknown distributions
  correspond to the well-known prophet inequality and to the secretary problem, respectively.
  Here we ask: Can a  stopping rule be competitive for the i.i.d. prophet inequality
  problem and the secretary problem at the same time? We constrain the Pareto frontier
  of simultaneous approximation ratios $(\alpha, \beta)$ that a stopping rule can
  attain. We introduce a family of algorithms that give nontrivial joint guarantees
  and are optimal for the extremal i.i.d. prophet and secretary problems. We also
  prove impossibilities, identifying $(\alpha, \beta)$ unattainable by any adaptive
  stopping rule. Our results hold for both $n$ fixed arrivals and for arrivals from
  a Poisson process with rate $n$. We work primarily in the Poisson setting, and provide
  reductions between the Poisson and $n$-arrival settings that may be of broader interest.'
