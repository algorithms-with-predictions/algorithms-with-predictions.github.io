abstract: The online assignment problem deals with assigning n elements of one set
  to another set which arrives sequentially on a one-to-one basis. This problem is
  also known as the online weighted bipartite matching which produces the smallest
  weight perfect matching possible. It plays an important role in the fields of operational
  research and computer science which is why immense attention has been given to improve
  its solution quality. Due to the incomplete information about the input, it is difficult
  for online algorithms to produce the optimal solution. The quality of the solution
  of an online algorithm is measured using a competitive ratio. It has been proven
  that for this problem, no online deterministic algorithm can achieve a competitive
  ratio better than (2n-1). It has been shown that advice in online computation improves
  the lower bound of the competitive ratio of online problems. Advice in online computation
  can be interpreted as additional information for the online algorithm to compensate
  for the lack of information about the whole input sequence. In this study, we investigate
  how introducing machine-learned advice could improve the competitive ratio for this
  problem. We provide an online algorithm for the online assignment problem by simulating
  a machine learning algorithm that predicts the whole input in advance. We utilize
  an optimal offline algorithm to provide a matching solution from the predicted input.
  Furthermore, we investigate how the prediction error of machine learning affects
  the competitive ratio of the online algorithm. We utilize a benchmark data set to
  perform our empirical analysis. We show that as the Machine Learning prediction
  error increases, the solution quality decreases. Moreover, the magnitude of error
  is directly proportional to the size of the input. This result is analo-gous to
  the competitive ratio of the best deterministic algorithm for the online assignment
  problem which is dependent also on the parameter n.
