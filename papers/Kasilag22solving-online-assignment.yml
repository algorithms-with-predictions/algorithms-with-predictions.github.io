abstract: The online assignment problem deals with assigning n elements of one set to another set which arrives sequentially
  on a one-to-one basis. This problem is also known as the online weighted bipartite matching which produces the smallest
  weight perfect matching possible. It plays an important role in the fields of operational research and computer science
  which is why immense attention has been given to improve its solution quality. Due to the incomplete information about the
  input, it is difficult for online algorithms to produce the optimal solution. The quality of the solution of an online algorithm
  is measured using a competitive ratio. It has been proven that for this problem, no online deterministic algorithm can achieve
  a competitive ratio better than (2n-1). It has been shown that advice in online computation improves the lower bound of
  the competitive ratio of online problems. Advice in online computation can be interpreted as additional information for
  the online algorithm to compensate for the lack of information about the whole input sequence. In this study, we investigate
  how introducing machine-learned advice could improve the competitive ratio for this problem. We provide an online algorithm
  for the online assignment problem by simulating a machine learning algorithm that predicts the whole input in advance. We
  utilize an optimal offline algorithm to provide a matching solution from the predicted input. Furthermore, we investigate
  how the prediction error of machine learning affects the competitive ratio of the online algorithm. We utilize a benchmark
  data set to perform our empirical analysis. We show that as the Machine Learning prediction error increases, the solution
  quality decreases. Moreover, the magnitude of error is directly proportional to the size of the input. This result is analo-gous
  to the competitive ratio of the best deterministic algorithm for the online assignment problem which is dependent also on
  the parameter n.
