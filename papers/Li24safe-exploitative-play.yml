title: Safe Exploitative Play with Untrusted Type Beliefs

abstract: The combination of the Bayesian game and learning has a rich history, with
  the idea of controlling a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with
  unknown behaviors given a set of types, each specifying a possible behavior for
  the other agents. The idea is to plan an agent's own actions with respect to those
  types which it believes are most likely to maximize the payoff. However, the type
  beliefs are often learned from past actions and likely to be incorrect. With this
  perspective in mind, we consider an agent in a game with type predictions of other
  components, and investigate the impact of incorrect beliefs to the agent's payoff.
  In particular, we formally define a tradeoff between risk and opportunity by comparing
  the payoff obtained against the optimal payoff, which is represented by a gap caused
  by trusting or distrusting the learned beliefs. Our main results characterize the
  tradeoff by establishing upper and lower bounds on the Pareto front for both normal-form
  and stochastic Bayesian games, with numerical results provided.
