title: The Supermarket Model with Known and Predicted Service Times
authors: Mitzenmacher, Dell Amico
abstract: The supermarket model refers to a system with a large number of queues,
  where arriving customers choose d queues at random and join the queue with the fewest
  customers. The supermarket model demonstrates the power of even small amounts of
  choice, as compared to simply joining a queue chosen uniformly at random, for load
  balancing systems. In this work we perform simulation-based studies to consider
  variations where service times for a customer are predicted, as might be done in
  modern settings using machine learning techniques or related mechanisms. Our primary
  takeaway is that using even seemingly weak predictions of service times can yield
  significant benefits over blind First In First Out queueing in this context. However,
  some care must be taken when using predicted service time information to both choose
  a queue and order elements for service within a queue; while in many cases using
  the information for both choosing and ordering is beneficial, in many of our simulation
  settings we find that simply using the number of jobs to choose a queue is better
  when using predicted service times to order jobs in a queue. In our simulations,
  we evaluate both synthetic and real-world workloads--in the latter, service times
  are predicted by machine learning. Our results provide practical guidance for the
  design of real-world systems; moreover, we leave many natural theoretical open questions
  for future work, validating their relevance to real-world situations.
