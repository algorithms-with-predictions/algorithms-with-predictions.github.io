abstract: We propose data-driven one-pass streaming algorithms for estimating the number of triangles and four cycles, two
  fundamental problems in graph analytics that are widely studied in the graph data stream literature. Recently, (Hsu 2018)
  and (Jiang 2020) applied machine learning techniques in other data stream problems, using a trained oracle that can predict
  certain properties of the stream elements to improve on prior"classical"algorithms that did not use oracles. In this paper,
  we explore the power of a"heavy edge"oracle in multiple graph edge streaming models. In the adjacency list model, we present
  a one-pass triangle counting algorithm improving upon the previous space upper bounds without such an oracle. In the arbitrary
  order model, we present algorithms for both triangle and four cycle estimation with fewer passes and the same space complexity
  as in previous algorithms, and we show several of these bounds are optimal. We analyze our algorithms under several noise
  models, showing that the algorithms perform well even when the oracle errs. Our methodology expands upon prior work on"classical"streaming
  algorithms, as previous multi-pass and random order streaming algorithms can be seen as special cases of our algorithms,
  where the first pass or random order was used to implement the heavy edge oracle. Lastly, our experiments demonstrate advantages
  of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art streaming algorithms.
