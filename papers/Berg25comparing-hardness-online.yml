title: Comparing the Hardness of Online Minimization and Maximization Problems with Predictions
authors: Magnus Berg
abstract: We build on the work of Berg, Boyar, Favrholdt, and Larsen, who developed a complexity theory for online problems
  with and without predictions (arXiv:2406.18265), focussing on minimization problems with binary predictions, where they
  define a hierarchy of complexity classes that classifies online problems based on the competitiveness of best possible deterministic
  online algorithms for each problem. We continue their work, focussing on online maximization problems. First, we compare
  the competitiveness of the base online minimization problem from Berg, Boyar, Favrholdt, and Larsen, Asymmetric String Guessing,
  to the competitiveness of Online Bounded Degree Independent Set. Formally, we show that there exist algorithms of any given
  competitiveness for Asymmetric String Guessing if and only if there exist algorithms of the same competitiveness for Online
  Bounded Degree Independent Set, while respecting that the competitiveness of algorithms is measured differently for minimization
  and maximization problems. Moreover, we give several hardness preserving reductions between different online maximization
  problems, which imply new membership, hardness, and completeness results for the complexity classes. Finally, we show new
  positive and negative algorithmic results for (among others) Online Bounded Degree Independent Set, Online Interval Scheduling,
  Online Set Packing, and Online Bounded Minimum Degree Clique.
