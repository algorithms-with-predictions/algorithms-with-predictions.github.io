title: Tight Bounds for Dynamic Bin Packing with Predictions
authors: Mozhengfu Liu, Xueyan Tang
abstract: A variant of the Dynamic Bin Packing (DBP) problem known as MinUsageTime
  DBP seeks to minimize the accumulated length of time for which bins are used in
  packing a sequence of items. This paper studies MinUsageTime DBP with predictions
  about item durations and establishes tight competitiveness bounds over the entire
  spectrum of prediction errors.
