title: Generalized Sorting with Predictions
authors: Pinyan Lu, Xuandi Ren, Enze Sun, Yubo Zhang
abstract: Generalized sorting problem, also known as sorting with forbidden comparisons, was first introduced by Huang et
  al. together with a randomized algorithm which requires $\tilde O(n^{3/2})$ probes. We study this problem with additional
  predictions for all pairs of allowed comparisons as input. We propose a randomized algorithm which uses $O(n \log n+w)$
  probes with high probability and a deterministic algorithm which uses $O(nw)$ probes, where $w$ is the number of mistakes
  made by prediction.
