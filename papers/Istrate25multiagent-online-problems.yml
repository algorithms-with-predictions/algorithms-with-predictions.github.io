title: On multiagent online problems with predictions
authors: Gabriel Istrate, Cosmin Bonchis, Victor Bogdan
abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor
  framework, that assumes that agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the behavior of the
  other players. The main problem we are concerned with is understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be
  achieved by employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality. As an illustration of our framework,
  we introduce and analyze a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling
  resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually
  for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost. In the particular
  case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions
  of agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties and benchmark it.
