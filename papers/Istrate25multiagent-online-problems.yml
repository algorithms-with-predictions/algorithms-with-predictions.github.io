title: On multiagent online problems with predictions
authors: Gabriel Istrate, C. Bonchis, Victor Bogdan
abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent
  setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that agents use one
  predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the behavior of the other
  players. The main problem we are concerned with is understanding what are the best
  competitive ratios that can be achieved by employing such predictors, under various
  assumptions on predictor quality. As an illustration of our framework, we introduce
  and analyze a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents
  can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the
  license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the
  day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone
  at no extra cost. In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm
  that follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of agent's
  future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties and benchmark
  it.
