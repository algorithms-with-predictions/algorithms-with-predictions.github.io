title: Learning-Augmented Weighted Paging
authors: Bansal, Coester, Kumar, Purohit, Vee
abstract: We consider a natural semi-online model for weighted paging, where at any
  time the algorithm is given predictions, possibly with errors, about the next arrival
  of each page. The model is inspired by Belady’s classic optimal offline algorithm
  for unweighted paging, and extends the recently studied model for learning-augmented
  paging [45, 50, 52] to the weighted setting. For the case of perfect predictions,
  we provide an l-competitive deterministic and an O (log l)-competitive randomized
  algorithm, where l is the number of distinct weight classes. Both these bounds are
  tight, and imply an O (logW)and O (log logW)-competitive ratio, respectively, when
  the page weights lie between 1 and W . Previously, it was not known how to use these
  predictions in the weighted setting and only bounds of k and O (log k) were known,
  where k is the cache size. Our results also generalize to the interleaved paging
  setting and to the case of imperfect predictions, with the competitive ratios degrading
  smoothly from O (l) and O (log l) to O (k) and O (log k), respectively, as the prediction
  error increases. Our results are based on several insights on structural properties
  of Belady’s algorithm and the sequence of page arrival predictions, and novel potential
  functions that incorporate these predictions. For the case of unweighted paging,
  the results imply a very simple potential function based proof of the optimality
  of Belady’s algorithm, which may be of independent interest.
