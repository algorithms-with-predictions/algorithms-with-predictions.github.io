title: 'Online Metric Matching: Beyond the Worst Case'
authors: Yang, Yu
abstract: We study the online metric matching problem. There are $m$ servers and $n$
  requests located in a metric space, where all servers are available upfront and
  requests arrive one at a time. Upon the arrival of a new request, it needs to be
  immediately and irrevocably matched to an available server, resulting in a cost
  of their distance. The objective is to minimize the total matching cost. When servers
  are adversarial and requests are independently drawn from a known distribution,
  we reduce the problem to a more tractable setting where servers and requests are
  all independently drawn from the same distribution. Applying our reduction, for
  $[0, 1]^d$ with various choices of distributions, we achieve improved competitive
  ratios and nearly optimal regret in both balanced and unbalanced markets. In particular,
  we give $O(1)$-competitive algorithms for $d \geq 3$ in both balanced and unbalanced
  markets with smooth distributions. Our algorithms improve on the $O((\log \log \log
  n)^2)$ competitive ratio of Gupta et al. (ICALP'19) for balanced markets in various
  regimes, and provide the first positive results for unbalanced markets. Moreover,
  when servers and requests are all adversarial, and a prediction of request locations
  is provided, we present a general framework for transforming an arbitrary algorithm
  that does not use predictions into an algorithm that leverages predictions. The
  transformation applies the given algorithm in a black-box manner, and the performance
  of the resulting algorithm degrades smoothly as the prediction accuracy deteriorates
  while preserving the worst-case guarantee.
