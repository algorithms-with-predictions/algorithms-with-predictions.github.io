title: Learning-augmented Online Minimization of Age of Information and Transmission Costs

abstract: 'We consider a discrete-time system where a resource-constrained source (e.g., a small sensor) transmits its time-sensitive
  data to a destination over a time-varying wireless channel. Each transmission incurs a fixed transmission cost (e.g., energy
  cost), and no transmission results in a staleness cost represented by the Age-of-Information. The source must balance the
  tradeoff between transmission and staleness costs. To address this challenge, we develop a robust online algorithm to minimize
  the sum of transmission and staleness costs, ensuring a worst-case performance guarantee. While online algorithms are robust,
  they are usually overly conservative and may have a poor average performance in typical scenarios. In contrast, by leveraging
  historical data and prediction models, machine learning (ML) algorithms perform well in average cases. However, they typically
  lack worst-case performance guarantees. To achieve the best of both worlds, we design a learning-augmented online algorithm
  that exhibits two desired properties: (i) consistency: closely approximating the optimal offline algorithm when the ML prediction
  is accurate and trusted; (ii) robustness: ensuring worst-case performance guarantee even ML predictions are inaccurate.
  Finally, we perform extensive simulations to show that our online algorithm performs well empirically and that our learning-auamented
  algorithm achieves both consistency and robustness.'
