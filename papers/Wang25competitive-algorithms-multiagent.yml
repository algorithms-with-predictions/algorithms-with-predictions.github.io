abstract: 'This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes
  the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual
  and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost,
  or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted
  group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents''active days
  differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To
  address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive
  ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we
  design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic
  policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states,
  while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware
  distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents
  use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive
  ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent
  settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making
  under uncertainty.'
