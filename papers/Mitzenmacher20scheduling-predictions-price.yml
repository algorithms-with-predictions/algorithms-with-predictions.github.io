title: Scheduling with Predictions and the Price of Misprediction
authors: Michael Mitzenmacher
abstract: In many traditional job scheduling settings, it is assumed that one knows the time it will take for a job to complete
  service. In such cases, strategies such as shortest job first can be used to improve performance in terms of measures such
  as the average time a job waits in the system. We consider the setting where the service time is not known, but is predicted
  by for example a machine learning algorithm. Our main result is the derivation, under natural assumptions, of formulae for
  the performance of several strategies for queueing systems that use predictions for service times in order to schedule jobs.
  As part of our analysis, we suggest the framework of the "price of misprediction," which offers a measure of the cost of
  using predicted information.
