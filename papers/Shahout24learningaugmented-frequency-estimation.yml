title: Learning-Augmented Frequency Estimation in Sliding Windows
authors: Shahout, Sabek, Mitzenmacher
abstract: We show how to utilize machine learning approaches to improve sliding window
  algorithms for approximate frequency estimation problems, under the “algorithms
  with predictions” framework. In this dynamic environment, previous learning-augmented
  algorithms are less effective, since properties in sliding window resolution can
  differ significantly from the properties of the entire stream. Our focus is on the
  benefits of predicting and filtering out items with large next arrival times – that
  is, there is a large gap until their next appearance – from the stream, which we
  show improves the memory-accuracy tradeoffs significantly. We provide theorems that
  provide insight into how and by how much our technique can improve the sliding window
  algorithm, as well as experimental results using real-world data sets. Our work
  demonstrates that predictors can be useful in the challenging sliding window setting.
