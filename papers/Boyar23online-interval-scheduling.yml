title: Online Interval Scheduling with Predictions
authors: Joan Boyar, Lene M. Favrholdt, Shahin Kamali, Kim S. Larsen
abstract: In online interval scheduling, the input is an online sequence of intervals, and the goal is to accept a maximum
  number of non-overlapping intervals. In the more general disjoint path allocation problem, the input is a sequence of requests,
  each consisting of pairs of vertices of a known graph, and the goal is to accept a maximum number of requests forming edge-disjoint
  paths between accepted pairs. We study a setting with a potentially erroneous prediction specifying the set of requests
  forming the input sequence and provide tight upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratios of online algorithms as a
  function of the prediction error. We also present asymptotically tight trade-offs between consistency (competitive ratio
  with error-free predictions) and robustness (competitive ratio with adversarial predictions) of interval scheduling algorithms.
  Finally, we provide experimental results on real-world scheduling workloads that confirm our theoretical analysis.
