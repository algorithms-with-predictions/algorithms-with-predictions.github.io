abstract: In this paper, we study learning-augmented algorithms for the Bahncard problem.
  The Bahncard problem is a generalization of the ski-rental problem, where a traveler
  needs to irrevocably and repeatedly decide between a cheap short-term solution and
  an expensive long-term one with an unknown future. Even though the problem is canonical,
  only a primal-dual-based learning-augmented algorithm was explicitly designed for
  it. We develop a new learning-augmented algorithm, named PFSUM, that incorporates
  both history and short-term future to improve online decision making. We derive
  the competitive ratio of PFSUM as a function of the prediction error and conduct
  extensive experiments to show that PFSUM outperforms the primal-dual-based algorithm.
