title: A Novel Prediction Setup for Online Speed-Scaling
authors: Antonios Antoniadis, Peyman Jabbarzade, Golnoosh Shahkarami
abstract: 'Given the rapid rise in energy demand by data centers and computing systems in general, it is fundamental to incorporate
  energy considerations when designing (scheduling) algorithms. Machine learning can be a useful approach in practice by predicting
  the future load of the system based on, for example, historical data. However, the effectiveness of such an approach highly
  depends on the quality of the predictions and can be quite far from optimal when predictions are sub-par. On the other hand,
  while providing a worst-case guarantee, classical online algorithms can be pessimistic for large classes of inputs arising
  in practice. This paper, in the spirit of the new area of machine learning augmented algorithms, attempts to obtain the
  best of both worlds for the classical, deadline based, online speed-scaling problem: Based on the introduction of a novel
  prediction setup, we develop algorithms that (i) obtain provably low energy-consumption in the presence of adequate predictions,
  and (ii) are robust against inadequate predictions, and (iii) are smooth, i.e., their performance gradually degrades as
  the prediction error increases.'
