title: Minimalistic Predictions to Schedule Jobs with Online Precedence Constraints
authors: Alexandra Anna Lassota, Alexander Lindermayr, Nicole Megow, Jens Schlöter
abstract: 'We consider non-clairvoyant scheduling with online precedence constraints, where an algorithm is oblivious to any
  job dependencies and learns about a job only if all of its predecessors have been completed. Given strong impossibility
  results in classical competitive analysis, we investigate the problem in a learning-augmented setting, where an algorithm
  has access to predictions without any quality guarantee. We discuss different prediction models: novel problem-specific
  models as well as general ones, which have been proposed in previous works. We present lower bounds and algorithmic upper
  bounds for different precedence topologies, and thereby give a structured overview on which and how additional (possibly
  erroneous) information helps for designing better algorithms. Along the way, we also improve bounds on traditional competitive
  ratios for existing algorithms.'
