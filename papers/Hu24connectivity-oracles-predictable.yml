title: Connectivity Oracles for Predictable Vertex Failures
authors: Bingbing Hu, Evangelos Kosinas, Adam Polak
abstract: 'The problem of designing connectivity oracles supporting vertex failures
  is one of the basic data structures problems for undirected graphs. It is already
  well understood: previous works [Duan--Pettie STOC''10; Long--Saranurak FOCS''22]
  achieve query time linear in the number of failed vertices, and it is conditionally
  optimal as long as we require preprocessing time polynomial in the size of the graph
  and update time polynomial in the number of failed vertices. We revisit this problem
  in the paradigm of algorithms with predictions: we ask if the query time can be
  improved if the set of failed vertices can be predicted beforehand up to a small
  number of errors. More specifically, we design a data structure that, given a graph
  $G=(V,E)$ and a set of vertices predicted to fail $\widehat{D} \subseteq V$ of size
  $d=|\widehat{D}|$, preprocesses it in time $\tilde{O}(d|E|)$ and then can receive
  an update given as the symmetric difference between the predicted and the actual
  set of failed vertices $\widehat{D} \triangle D = (\widehat{D} \setminus D) \cup
  (D \setminus \widehat{D})$ of size $\eta = |\widehat{D} \triangle D|$, process it
  in time $\tilde{O}(\eta^4)$, and after that answer connectivity queries in $G \setminus
  D$ in time $O(\eta)$. Viewed from another perspective, our data structure provides
  an improvement over the state of the art for the \emph{fully dynamic subgraph connectivity
  problem} in the \emph{sensitivity setting} [Henzinger--Neumann ESA''16]. We argue
  that the preprocessing time and query time of our data structure are conditionally
  optimal under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions.'
