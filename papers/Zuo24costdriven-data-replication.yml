title: Cost-Driven Data Replication with Predictions
authors: Tianyu Zuo, Xueyan Tang, Bu-Sung Lee
abstract: This paper studies an online replication problem for distributed data access. The goal is to dynamically create
  and delete data copies in a multi-server system as time passes to minimize the total storage and network cost of serving
  access requests. We study the problem in the emergent learning-augmented setting, assuming simple binary predictions about
  inter-request times at individual servers. We develop an online algorithm and prove that it is (5+α/3)-consistent (competitiveness
  under perfect predictions) and (1+1/α)-robust (competitiveness under terrible predictions), where α◰(0, 1] is a hyper-parameter
  representing the level of distrust in the predictions. We also study the impact of mispredictions on the competitive ratio
  of the proposed algorithm and adapt it to achieve a bounded robustness while retaining its consistency. We further establish
  a lower bound of 3/2 on the consistency of any deterministic learning-augmented algorithm. Experimental evaluations are
  carried out to evaluate our algorithms using real data access traces.
