title: Faster Fundamental Graph Algorithms via Learned Predictions
authors: Justin Y. Chen, Sandeep Silwal, A. Vakilian, Fred Zhang
abstract: 'We consider the question of speeding up classic graph algorithms with machine-learned predictions. In this model,
  algorithms are furnished with extra advice learned from past or similar instances. Given the additional information, we
  aim to improve upon the traditional worst-case run-time guarantees. Our contributions are the following: Finally, we give
  a set of general learnability theorems, showing that the predictions required by our algorithms can be efficiently learned
  in a PAC fashion.'
