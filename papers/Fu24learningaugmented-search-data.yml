abstract: We study the integration of machine learning advice to improve upon traditional
  data structure designed for efficient search queries. Although there has been recent
  effort in improving the performance of binary search trees using machine learning
  advice, e.g., Lin et. al. (ICML 2022), the resulting constructions nevertheless
  suffer from inherent weaknesses of binary search trees, such as complexity of maintaining
  balance across multiple updates and the inability to handle partially-ordered or
  high-dimensional datasets. For these reasons, we focus on skip lists and KD trees
  in this work. Given access to a possibly erroneous oracle that outputs estimated
  fractional frequencies for search queries on a set of items, we construct skip lists
  and KD trees that provably provides the optimal expected search time, within nearly
  a factor of two. In fact, our learning-augmented skip lists and KD trees are still
  optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant
  factor. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structures achieves
  an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list/KD
  tree construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect. Finally,
  we empirically show that our learning-augmented search data structures outperforms
  their corresponding traditional analogs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
