title: Learning to Hash Robustly, Guaranteed
authors: Andoni, Beaglehole
abstract: The indexing algorithms for the high-dimensional nearest neighbor search
  (NNS) with the best worst-case guarantees are based on the randomized Locality Sensitive
  Hashing (LSH), and its derivatives. In practice, many heuristic approaches exist
  to "learn" the best indexing method in order to speed-up NNS, crucially adapting
  to the structure of the given dataset. Oftentimes, these heuristics outperform the
  LSH-based algorithms on real datasets, but, almost always, come at the cost of losing
  the guarantees of either correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries,
  or apply to datasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper, we design
  an NNS algorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially
  matching that of theoretical algorithms, while optimizing the hashing to the structure
  of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on the minimum-performing
  query. We evaluate the algorithm’s ability to optimize for a given dataset both
  theoretically and practically. On the theoretical side, we exhibit a natural setting
  (dataset model) where our algorithm is much better than the standard theoretical
  one. On the practical side, we run experiments that show that our algorithm has
  a 1.8x and 2.1x better recall on the worst-performing queries to the MNIST and ImageNet
  datasets.
