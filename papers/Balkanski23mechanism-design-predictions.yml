title: 'Mechanism Design with Predictions: An Annotated Reading List'
authors: Eric Balkanski, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Xizhi Tan
abstract: A surge of recent work has focused on analyzing the performance of algorithms guided by predictions, aiming to enhance
  their worst-case performance guarantees with improved guarantees when the predictions are accurate. This "learning-augmented"
  framework was recently also extended to mechanism design settings involving strategic agents and we provide an overview
  of these results.
