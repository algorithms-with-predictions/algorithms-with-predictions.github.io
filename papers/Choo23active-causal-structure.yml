title: Active causal structure learning with advice
authors: Davin Choo, Themistoklis Gouleakis, Arnab Bhattacharyya
abstract: We introduce the problem of active causal structure learning with advice. In the typical well-studied setting, the
  learning algorithm is given the essential graph for the observational distribution and is asked to recover the underlying
  causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G^*$ while minimizing the number of interventions made. In our setting, we are additionally
  given side information about $G^*$ as advice, e.g. a DAG $G$ purported to be $G^*$. We ask whether the learning algorithm
  can benefit from the advice when it is close to being correct, while still having worst-case guarantees even when the advice
  is arbitrarily bad. Our work is in the same space as the growing body of research on algorithms with predictions. When the
  advice is a DAG $G$, we design an adaptive search algorithm to recover $G^*$ whose intervention cost is at most $O(\max\{1,
  \log \psi\})$ times the cost for verifying $G^*$; here, $\psi$ is a distance measure between $G$ and $G^*$ that is upper
  bounded by the number of variables $n$, and is exactly 0 when $G=G^*$. Our approximation factor matches the state-of-the-art
  for the advice-less setting.
