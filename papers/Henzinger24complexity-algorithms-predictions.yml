abstract: '{\em Algorithms with predictions} incorporate machine learning predictions into algorithm design. A plethora of
  recent works incorporated predictions to improve on worst-case optimal bounds for online problems. In this paper, we initiate
  the study of complexity of dynamic data structures with predictions, including dynamic graph algorithms. Unlike in online
  algorithms, the main goal in dynamic data structures is to maintain the solution {\em efficiently} with every update. Motivated
  by work in online algorithms, we investigate three natural models of predictions: (1) $\varepsilon$-accurate predictions
  where each predicted request matches the true request with probability at least $\varepsilon$, (2) list-accurate predictions
  where a true request comes from a list of possible requests, and (3) bounded delay predictions where the true requests are
  some (unknown) permutations of the predicted requests. For $\varepsilon$-accurate predictions, we show that lower bounds
  from the non-prediction setting of a problem carry over, up to a $1-\varepsilon$ factor. Then we give general reductions
  among the prediction models for a problem, showing that lower bounds for bounded delay imply lower bounds for list-accurate
  predictions, which imply lower bounds for $\varepsilon$-accurate predictions. Further, we identify two broad problem classes
  based on lower bounds due to the Online Matrix Vector (OMv) conjecture. Specifically, we show that dynamic problems that
  are {\em locally correctable} have strong conditional lower bounds for list-accurate predictions that are equivalent to
  the non-prediction setting, unless list-accurate predictions are perfect. Moreover, dynamic problems that are {\em locally
  reducible} have a smooth transition in the running time. We categorize problems accordingly and give upper bounds that show
  that our lower bounds are almost tight, including problems in dynamic graphs.'
