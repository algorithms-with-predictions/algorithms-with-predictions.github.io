abstract: 'A variant of the online knapsack problem is considered in the settings of trusted and untrusted predictions. In
  Unit Profit Knapsack, the items have unit profit, and it is easy to find an optimal solution offline: Pack as many of the
  smallest items as possible into the knapsack. For Online Unit Profit Knapsack, the competitive ratio is unbounded. In contrast,
  previous work on online algorithms with untrusted predictions generally studied problems where an online algorithm with
  a constant competitive ratio is known. The prediction, possibly obtained from a machine learning source, that our algorithm
  uses is the average size of those smallest items that fit in the knapsack. For the prediction error in this hard online
  problem, we use the ratio $r=\frac{a}{\hat{a}}$ where $a$ is the actual value for this average size and $\hat{a}$ is the
  prediction. The algorithm presented achieves a competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{2r}$ for $r\geq 1$ and $\frac{r}{2}$ for $r\leq
  1$. Using an adversary technique, we show that this is optimal in some sense, giving a trade-off in the competitive ratio
  attainable for different values of $r$. Note that the result for accurate advice, $r=1$, is only $\frac{1}{2}$, but we show
  that no algorithm knowing the value $a$ can achieve a competitive ratio better than $\frac{e-1}{e}\approx 0.6321$ and present
  an algorithm with a matching upper bound. We also show that this latter algorithm attains a competitive ratio of $r\frac{e-1}{e}$
  for $r \leq 1$ and $\frac{e-r}{e}$ for $1 \leq r'
