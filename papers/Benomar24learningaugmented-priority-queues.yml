title: Learning-Augmented Priority Queues
authors: Ziyad Benomar, Christian Coester
abstract: Priority queues are one of the most fundamental and widely used data structures in computer science. Their primary
  objective is to efficiently support the insertion of new elements with assigned priorities and the extraction of the highest
  priority element. In this study, we investigate the design of priority queues within the learning-augmented framework, where
  algorithms use potentially inaccurate predictions to enhance their worst-case performance. We examine three prediction models
  spanning different use cases, and show how the predictions can be leveraged to enhance the performance of priority queue
  operations. Moreover, we demonstrate the optimality of our solution and discuss some possible applications.
