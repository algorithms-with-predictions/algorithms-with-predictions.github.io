abstract: 'A central goal in algorithmic game theory is to analyze the performance of decentralized multiagent systems, like
  communication and information networks. In the absence of a central planner who can enforce how these systems are utilized,
  the users can strategically interact with the system, aiming to maximize their own utility, possibly leading to very inefficient
  outcomes, and thus a high price of anarchy. To alleviate this issue, the system designer can use decentralized mechanisms
  that regulate the use of each resource (e.g., using local queuing protocols or scheduling mechanisms), but with only limited
  information regarding the state of the system. These information limitations have a severe impact on what such decentralized
  mechanisms can achieve, so most of the success stories in this literature have had to make restrictive assumptions (e.g.,
  by either restricting the structure of the networks or the types of cost functions). In this paper, we overcome some of
  the obstacles that the literature has imposed on decentralized mechanisms, by designing mechanisms that are enhanced with
  predictions regarding the missing information. Specifically, inspired by the big success of the literature on "algorithms
  with predictions", we design decentralized mechanisms with predictions and evaluate their price of anarchy as a function
  of the prediction error, focusing on two very well-studied classes of games: scheduling games and multicast network formation
  games.'
