abstract: 'We study the problem of designing procurement auctions for the strategic uncapacitated facility location problem:
  a company needs to procure a set of facility locations in order to serve its customers and each facility location is owned
  by a strategic agent. Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling
  it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities
  the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary
  cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate
  the performance of these auctions using the \emph{frugality ratio}. We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG
  auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework
  and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners''private costs. Specifically, we propose a
  family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading
  to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions
  are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions. We finally
  provide a family of ``error-tolerant''''auctions that maintain improved frugality ratios even if the predictions are only
  approximately accurate, and we provide upper bounds on their frugality ratio as a function of the prediction error.'
