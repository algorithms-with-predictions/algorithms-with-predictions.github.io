title: On the Power of Learning-Augmented Search Trees
authors: Jingbang Chen, Xinyuan Cao, Alicia Stepin, L. Chen
abstract: We study learning-augmented binary search trees (BSTs) via Treaps with carefully
  designed priorities. The result is a simple search tree in which the depth of each
  item $x$ is determined by its predicted weight $w_x$. Specifically, each item $x$
  is assigned a composite priority of $-\lfloor\log\log(1/w_x)\rfloor + U(0, 1)$ where
  $U(0, 1)$ is the uniform random variable. By choosing $w_x$ as the relative frequency
  of $x$, the resulting search trees achieve static optimality. This approach generalizes
  the recent learning-augmented BSTs [Lin-Luo-Woodruff ICML '22], which only work
  for Zipfian distributions, by extending them to arbitrary input distributions. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate that our method can be generalized to a B-Tree data structure using
  the B-Treap approach [Golovin ICALP '09]. Our search trees are also capable of leveraging
  localities in the access sequence through online self-reorganization, thereby achieving
  the working-set property. Additionally, they are robust to prediction errors and
  support dynamic operations, such as insertions, deletions, and prediction updates.
  We complement our analysis with an empirical study, demonstrating that our method
  outperforms prior work and classic data structures.
