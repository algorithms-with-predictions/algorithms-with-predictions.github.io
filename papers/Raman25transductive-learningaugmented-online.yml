title: Transductive and Learning-Augmented Online Regression
authors: Vinod Raman, Shenghao Xie, Samson Zhou
abstract: Motivated by the predictable nature of real-life in data streams, we study online regression when the learner has
  access to predictions about future examples. In the extreme case, called transductive online learning, the sequence of examples
  is revealed to the learner before the game begins. For this setting, we fully characterize the minimax expected regret in
  terms of the fat-shattering dimension, establishing a separation between transductive online regression and (adversarial)
  online regression. Then, we generalize this setting by allowing for noisy or \emph{imperfect} predictions about future examples.
  Using our results for the transductive online setting, we develop an online learner whose minimax expected regret matches
  the worst-case regret, improves smoothly with prediction quality, and significantly outperforms the worst-case regret when
  future example predictions are precise, achieving performance similar to the transductive online learner. This enables learnability
  for previously unlearnable classes under predictable examples, aligning with the broader learning-augmented model paradigm.
