title: Transductive and Learning-Augmented Online Regression
authors: Raman, Xie, Zhou
abstract: Motivated by the predictable nature of real-life in data streams, we study
  online regression when the learner has access to predictions about future examples.
  In the extreme case, called transductive online learning, the sequence of examples
  is revealed to the learner before the game begins. For this setting, we fully characterize
  the minimax expected regret in terms of the fat-shattering dimension, establishing
  a separation between transductive online regression and (adversarial) online regression.
  Then, we generalize this setting by allowing for noisy or \emph{imperfect} predictions
  about future examples. Using our results for the transductive online setting, we
  develop an online learner whose minimax expected regret matches the worst-case regret,
  improves smoothly with prediction quality, and significantly outperforms the worst-case
  regret when future example predictions are precise, achieving performance similar
  to the transductive online learner. This enables learnability for previously unlearnable
  classes under predictable examples, aligning with the broader learning-augmented
  model paradigm.
