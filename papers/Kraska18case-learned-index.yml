title: The Case for Learned Index Structures
authors: Tim Kraska, Alex Beutel, Ed H. Chi, J. Dean, N. Polyzotis
abstract: 'Indexes are models: a \btree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key
  to the position of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map
  a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as
  a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this exploratory research
  paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can
  be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we
  term \em learned indexes. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned
  indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges
  in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show that our learned
  indexes can have significant advantages over traditional indexes. More importantly,
  we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system
  through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs
  and that this work provides just a glimpse of what might be possible.'
