abstract: 'Algorithms with (machine-learned) predictions is a powerful framework for combining traditional worst-case algorithms
  with modern machine learning. However, the vast majority of work in this space assumes that the prediction itself is non-probabilistic,
  even if it is generated by some stochastic process (such as a machine learning system). This is a poor fit for modern ML,
  particularly modern neural networks, which naturally generate a distribution. We initiate the study of algorithms with distributional
  predictions, where the prediction itself is a distribution. We focus on one of the simplest yet fundamental settings: binary
  search (or searching a sorted array). This setting has one of the simplest algorithms with a point prediction, but what
  happens if the prediction is a distribution? We show that this is a richer setting: there are simple distributions where
  using the classical prediction-based algorithm with any single prediction does poorly. Motivated by this, as our main result,
  we give an algorithm with query complexity $O(H(p) + \log \eta)$, where $H(p)$ is the entropy of the true distribution $p$
  and $\eta$ is the earth mover''s distance between $p$ and the predicted distribution $\hat p$. This also yields the first
  distributionally-robust algorithm for the classical problem of computing an optimal binary search tree given a distribution
  over target keys. We complement this with a lower bound showing that this query complexity is essentially optimal (up to
  constants), and experiments validating the practical usefulness of our algorithm.'
