title: Single-Leg Revenue Management with Advice
authors: Balseiro, Kroer, Kumar
abstract: 'Single-leg revenue management is a foundational problem of revenue management
  that has been particularly impactful in the airline and hotel industry: Given n
  units of a resource, e.g. flight seats, and a stream of sequentially-arriving customers
  segmented by fares, what is the optimal online policy for allocating the resource.
  Previous work focused on designing algorithms when forecasts are available, which
  are not robust to inaccuracies in the forecast, or online algorithms with worst-case
  performance guarantees, which can be too conservative in practice. In this work,
  we look at the single-leg revenue management problem through the lens of the algorithms-with-advice
  framework, which attempts to harness the increasing prediction accuracy of machine
  learning methods by optimally incorporating advice about the future into online
  algorithms. In particular, we develop online algorithms which optimally trade-off
  consistency (performance when advice is accurate) and competitiveness (performance
  when advice is inaccurate) for every advice. Our results extend to other unit-cost
  online allocations problems such as the display advertising and the multiple secretary
  problem together with more general variable-cost problems such as the online knapsack
  problem.'
