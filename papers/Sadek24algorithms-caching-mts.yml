abstract: ML-augmented algorithms utilize predictions to achieve performance beyond
  their worst-case bounds. Producing these predictions might be a costly operation
  -- this motivated Im et al. '22 to introduce the study of algorithms which use predictions
  parsimoniously. We design parsimonious algorithms for caching and MTS with action
  predictions, proposed by Antoniadis et al. '20, focusing on the parameters of consistency
  (performance with perfect predictions) and smoothness (dependence of their performance
  on the prediction error). Our algorithm for caching is 1-consistent, robust, and
  its smoothness deteriorates with the decreasing number of available predictions.
  We propose an algorithm for general MTS whose consistency and smoothness both scale
  linearly with the decreasing number of predictions. Without the restriction on the
  number of available predictions, both algorithms match the earlier guarantees achieved
  by Antoniadis et al. '20.
