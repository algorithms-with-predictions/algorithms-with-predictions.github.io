title: Better and simpler learning-augmented online caching
authors: Alexander Wei
abstract: 'Lykouris and Vassilvitskii (ICML 2018) introduce a model of online caching
  with machine-learned advice, where each page request additionally comes with a prediction
  of when that page will next be requested. In this model, a natural goal is to design
  algorithms that (1) perform well when the advice is accurate and (2) remain robust
  in the worst case a la traditional competitive analysis. Lykouris and Vassilvitskii
  give such an algorithm by adapting the Marker algorithm to the learning-augmented
  setting. In a recent work, Rohatgi (SODA 2020) improves on their result with an
  approach also inspired by randomized marking. We continue the study of this problem,
  but with a somewhat different approach: We consider combining the BlindOracle algorithm,
  which just naively follows the predictions, with an optimal competitive algorithm
  for online caching in a black-box manner. The resulting algorithm outperforms all
  existing approaches while being significantly simpler. Moreover, we show that combining
  BlindOracle with LRU is in fact optimal among deterministic algorithms for this
  problem.'
