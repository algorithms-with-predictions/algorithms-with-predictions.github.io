abstract: We study the online problem of minimizing power consumption in systems with multiple power-saving states. During
  idle periods of unknown lengths, an algorithm has to choose between power-saving states of different energy consumption
  and wake-up costs. We develop a learning-augmented online algorithm that makes decisions based on (potentially inaccurate)
  predicted lengths of the idle periods. The algorithm's performance is near-optimal when predictions are accurate and degrades
  gracefully with increasing prediction error, with a worst-case guarantee almost identical to the optimal classical online
  algorithm for the problem. A key ingredient in our approach is a new algorithm for the online ski rental problem in the
  learning augmented setting with tight dependence on the prediction error. We support our theoretical findings with experiments.
