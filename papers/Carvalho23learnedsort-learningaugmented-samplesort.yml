title: 'LearnedSort as a learning-augmented SampleSort: Analysis and Parallelization'
authors: Carvalho, Lawrence
abstract: This work analyzes and parallelizes LearnedSort, the novel algorithm that
  sorts using machine learning models based on the cumulative distribution function.
  LearnedSort is analyzed under the lens of algorithms with predictions, and it is
  argued that LearnedSort is a learning-augmented SampleSort. A parallel LearnedSort
  algorithm is developed combining LearnedSort with the state-of-the-art SampleSort
  implementation, IPS4o. Benchmarks on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  improved parallel performance for parallel LearnedSort compared to IPS4o and other
  sorting algorithms.
