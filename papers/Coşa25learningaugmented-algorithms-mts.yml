title: Learning-Augmented Algorithms for MTS with Bandit Access to Multiple Predictors
authors: Coşa, Eliáš
abstract: 'We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for Metrical
  Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type of input instances.
  While processing an input instance received online, we are allowed to query the
  action of only one of the heuristics at each time step. Our goal is to achieve performance
  comparable to the best of the given heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting
  comes from the fact that the cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated
  unless the same heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit
  Learning against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to
  achieve regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
  construction of Dekel et al. (2013).'
