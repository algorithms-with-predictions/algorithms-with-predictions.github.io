title: Learning-Augmented Online Bipartite Fractional Matching
authors: Davin Choo, Billy Jin, Yongho Shin
abstract: Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization, extensively studied both in its integral
  and fractional forms due to its theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising and resource
  allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching
  when the algorithm is given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop algorithms for both
  the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably dominate the naive"coin flip"strategy of randomly choosing between
  the advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the vertex-weighted setting extends to the
  AdWords problem under the small bids assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of Mahdian, Nazerzadeh,
  and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency
  tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our algorithms through experiments on synthetic and
  real-world data.
