title: Byzantine Agreement with Predictions
authors: Naama Ben-David, M. A. Dzulfikar, Faith Ellen, S. Gilbert
abstract: We study the problem of Byzantine Agreement with predictions in synchronous
  message passing systems. Along with a proposal, each process is also given a prediction,
  i.e., extra information that is not guaranteed to be true. For example, one might
  imagine that the prediction is produced by a network security monitoring service
  that looks for patterns of malicious behavior. Our goal is to design an algorithm
  that is more efficient when the predictions are accurate, smoothly degrades in performance
  as predictions decrease in accuracy, and in the worst case performs (almost) as
  well as any algorithm without predictions even when the predictions are completely
  inaccurate. On the negative side, we show that Byzantine Agreement with predictions
  still requires Ω(n + t2) messages, even in executions where the predictions are
  completely accurate. On the positive side, we show that classification predictions,
  which provide information about which processes might be faulty, can help improve
  the round complexity of synchronous Byzantine Agreement. We present new algorithms
  that leverage classification predictions to yield better round complexity, and we
  show that the round complexity achieved is (almost) optimal as a function of the
  prediction quality.
