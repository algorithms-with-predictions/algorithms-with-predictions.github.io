abstract: We revisit the online dynamic acknowledgment problem. In the problem, a sequence of requests arrive over time to
  be acknowledged, and all outstanding requests can be satisfied simultaneously by one acknowledgement. The goal of the problem
  is to minimize the total request delay plus acknowledgement cost. This elegant model studies the tradeoff between acknowledgement
  cost and waiting experienced by requests. The problem has been well studied and the tight competitive ratios have been determined.
  For this well-studied problem, we focus on how to effectively use machine-learned predictions to have better performance.We
  develop algorithms that perform arbitrarily close to the optimum with accurate predictions while concurrently having the
  guarantees arbitrarily close to what the best online algorithms can offer without access to predictions, thereby achieving
  simultaneous optimum consistency and robustness. This new result is enabled by our novel prediction error measure. No error
  measure was defined for the problem prior to our work, and natural measures failed due to the challenge that requests with
  different arrival times have different effects on the objective. We hope our ideas can be used for other online problems
  with temporal aspects that have been resisting proper error measures.
