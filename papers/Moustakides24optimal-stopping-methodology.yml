title: Optimal Stopping Methodology for the Secretary Problem with Random Queries
authors: George V. Moustakides, Xujun Liu, Olgica Milenkovic
abstract: Abstract Candidates arrive sequentially for an interview process which results in them being ranked relative to
  their predecessors. Based on the ranks available at each time, a decision mechanism must be developed that selects or dismisses
  the current candidate in an effort to maximize the chance of selecting the best. This classical version of the ‘secretary
  problem’ has been studied in depth, mostly using combinatorial approaches, along with numerous other variants. We consider
  a particular new version where, during reviewing, it is possible to query an external expert to improve the probability
  of making the correct decision. Unlike existing formulations, we consider experts that are not necessarily infallible and
  may provide suggestions that can be faulty. For the solution of our problem we adopt a probabilistic methodology and view
  the querying times as consecutive stopping times which we optimize with the help of optimal stopping theory. For each querying
  time we must also design a mechanism to decide whether or not we should terminate the search at the querying time. This
  decision is straightforward under the usual assumption of infallible experts, but when experts are faulty it has a far more
  intricate structure.
