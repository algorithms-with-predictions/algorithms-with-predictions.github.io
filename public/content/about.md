## About

This website aims to collect and organize research papers on **algorithms with predictions** (also known as **algorithms with machine learning advice** or **learning-augmented algorithms**).

### What are Algorithms with Predictions?

Algorithms with predictions represent a fascinating intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning. These algorithms leverage machine learning predictions to improve their performance beyond worst-case guarantees, while maintaining robustness when predictions are inaccurate.

Key characteristics include:

- **Consistency**: Good performance when predictions are accurate
- **Robustness**: Reasonable performance when predictions are wrong  
- **Smoothness**: Performance degrades gracefully with prediction quality

### Research Areas

This field spans multiple domains of algorithmic research:

- **Online Algorithms**: Making decisions without knowing future inputs
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Finding near-optimal solutions efficiently
- **Streaming Algorithms**: Processing data with limited memory
- **Data Structures**: Optimizing access patterns with predicted queries
- **Scheduling**: Improving job scheduling with workload predictions
- **Network Problems**: Route optimization with traffic forecasts
