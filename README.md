A comprehensive, community-driven resource for research on **Algorithms with Predictions** -
maintaining an overview of the current state of research and collecting links to relevant materials
to help researchers navigate this rapidly growing field.

## üéØ Mission

The idea of this project is to maintain an overview over the current state of research on Algorithms
with Predictions and collect links to further relevant material. This should especially help new
researchers in this field to orient faster, but we also try to keep track over and cluster the large
amount of results and publications in this field.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìö **Comprehensive Paper Database**: Curated collection of research papers with metadata
- üîç **Smart Filtering**: Filter by publication year, venue, research area, and more
- üè∑Ô∏è **Topic Classification**: Papers organized by problem types and methodologies
- üîó **Direct Links**: Quick access to PDFs from arXiv, conference proceedings, and journals
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- ü§ñ **Automated Updates**: Integration with DBLP and arXiv for automatic paper metadata fetching

## How to Contribute in General

The sources and data for this webpage are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io). It
uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for static site rendering and is hosted via
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Everyone is very welcome to contribute:

- Maintain paper references, e.g. adding, updating and labeling references (see `papers/` directory
  and syntax below)
- Add and edit further material. This page is generated from the
  [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file `src/markdown-pages/material.md` and is
  thus easy to modify.
- Improve layout or design, add new features.

Most contributions can be done via Pull Requests directly in the repository. For more involved
suggestions or discussions, feel free to contact us
([alps-web@uni-bremen.de](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de)).

## Adding and Editing Paper References

Paper entries are based on YAML files, which are located in the directory `papers/`.

As an example, this is the data file for the caching paper by Lykouris and Vassilvitskii
(`LykourisV18competitive.yml`):

```yml
title: Competitive Caching with Machine Learned Advice
authors: Lykouris, Vassilvitskii
publications:
  - name: ICML
    year: 2018
    url: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/lykouris18a/lykouris18a.pdf
  - name: arXiv
    year: 2018
    month: 1 # optional
    day: 4 # optional
    url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05399.pdf
  - name: J. ACM
    year: 2021
    url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447579
labels:
  - online
  - caching/paging
```

If you want to add or change the entry of a paper, you can either add/edit the file via a Pull
Request or send us the file via [e-mail](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de). In case you want to add a
paper, please try to find a unique filename (as in the example above; but there are no strict
conventions).

## Automated Publication Fetching

It is also possible to only add the title and labels of a paper:

```yml
title: Competitive Caching with Machine Learned Advice
labels:
  - online
  - caching/paging
```

We use an
[automated procedure](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/blob/main/scripts/updateData.mjs)
to fetch the authors last names and all publications which have an (almost) matching title from
[DBLP](https://dblp.org) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). In this example, all three publications of
this paper can be added automatically.

## Local Development

You can start a local development instance of this webpage as follows:

First, clone
[this repository](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io)
and install dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server:
