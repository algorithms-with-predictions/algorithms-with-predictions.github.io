# üîç ALPS Database Gap Analysis Summary

## üìä Discovery Results

**Search completed:** October 31, 2025 **Papers analyzed:** 53 discovered from DBLP and ArXiv
**Genuinely missing:** 16 papers **Possible duplicates:** 5 papers (need manual review)

## üéØ Key Findings

### Missing High-Priority Papers

1. **Approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization with predictions** (2025, ICLR)
   - Authors: Antonios Antoniadis, Marek Eli√°s, Adam Polak
   - High-impact venue, directly relevant to ALPS

2. **Augmenting Online Algorithms with Œµ-Accurate Predictions** (2022, NeurIPS)
   - Authors: Anupam Gupta, Debmalya Panigrahi
   - Major ML venue, foundational work

3. **Online Algorithms with Predictions (Invited Talk)** (2023, MFCS)
   - Author: Joan Boyar
   - Survey/overview paper

### Recent Developments (2024-2025)

- **9 papers** from 2024-2025 discovered
- Strong activity in ArXiv and CoRR
- Emerging applications in control theory and systems

### Coverage Gaps Identified

- **Missing venues:** Some systems conferences (SIGMETRICS, NSDI)
- **Underrepresented areas:** Control theory applications, battery systems
- **Recent ArXiv papers:** Many preprints not yet in database

## üöÄ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 weeks)

1. **Review generated YAML templates** in `missing_papers/` directory
2. **Add high-priority papers** (items 1-3 above) to your database
3. **Check possible duplicates** manually - some may be different versions
4. **Set up ArXiv alerts** for cs.DS category with learning-augmented keywords

### Medium-term Strategy (Next month)

1. **Systematic venue coverage:**
   - SODA 2024-2025 proceedings review
   - ICLR 2024-2025 proceedings review
   - Recent NeurIPS algorithmic papers

2. **Author network expansion:**
   - Follow prolific authors' recent work
   - Check their students' and collaborators' papers

3. **Citation analysis:**
   - Use Google Scholar to find papers citing your existing ones
   - Look for "Cited by" lists from key papers

### Long-term Maintenance (Ongoing)

1. **Monthly searches** using the provided tools
2. **Automated alerts** from ArXiv, DBLP, and Google Scholar
3. **Conference proceedings monitoring** for major venues
4. **Community contributions** - engage with researchers in the field

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Available

### Ready-to-use Scripts

- `quick_paper_search.py` - Primary discovery tool
- `compare_papers.py` - Find missing papers and generate templates
- `analyze_dataset.py` - Database analysis and gap identification
- `discover_missing_papers.py` - Advanced multi-source search

### Next Execution

```bash
# Run monthly to find new papers
python scripts/quick_paper_search.py

# Analyze results
python scripts/compare_papers.py discovered_papers_[DATE].json --generate-yaml

# Review missing_papers/ directory and add relevant ones to papers/
```

## üìà Expected Growth

Based on current trends:

- **15-25 new papers per year** in learning-augmented algorithms
- **Increasing activity** in ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
- **Expanding applications** beyond traditional algorithms (systems, control, etc.)

## üéØ Search Quality Assessment

The discovery process found papers across multiple venues with good precision:

- **Theory venues:** SODA, ITCS, MFCS, SWAT
- **ML venues:** NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AISTATS
- **Application areas:** Control systems, networking, optimization

This indicates the search strategy is effective and captures the interdisciplinary nature of
learning-augmented algorithms.
